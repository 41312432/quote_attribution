DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Sorry.    Didn't mean to... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ, John Milton. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Have we been treating you well? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Your wife, she's had a good time? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Good. That's our secret. We kill you with kindness. (walking the room, circling) What's your secret? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You were a prosecutor. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Sixty-four straight convictions. What a number. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,What's that like? One day you're putting them away and the next you're setting them free? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Pays better though, doesn't it? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,The math teacher. The Gettys case. I hear you were brilliant. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Really.   So you think your guy was guilty. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,What did you say? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ, I was sure you had a secret. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I love it. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You don't really want to go back to Florida, do you? Walk with me. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,What do you think? Some people can't handle it. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Exactly. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,She never remarried? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,That can't be easy in Gainesville. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Little different when you're looking down, isn't it? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"'Many are in high places, and of great renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.' "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Didn't rub off on you?    The book? The church? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Lotta potential clients down there. (Sooner or later it all flows through the streets.) 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You like it here, don't you? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Always. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Because our clients break the law just like everyone else and I'm tired of sending their business across the street. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I'm thinking about it. You have the talent. I knew that before you got here. It's the other thing I wonder about. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Pressure. Changes everything. Some people, you squeeze them, they focus. Some people fold. Can you summon your talent at will? Can you deliver on deadline? Can you sleep at night? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Money's the easy part. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"There you go, Kevin. The whole team. I'm trying to think how long it's been since we were all together. All of us. Too long. I'm looking around, I know some of you came from very far away to be with us here today. It's appreciated. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Wait a minute. I got it. It's perfect. It's intimate. It's quick. Doesn't cost a thing. There's a power to it. What is it? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Right now. Every person at this table -- take the hand of the person on either side... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You want out of this, Eddie? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You won't hold hands? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"See.   See, I feel better already. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ," Bravo, Kevin. Bravo. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Kevin, what can I say? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Best street food in the world. Try that. Tell me it isn't great. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"What do you think? We're giving you away? He's paying us in goat's blood? I'm billing you out at four-hundred an hour, my friend. I don't see a whole lot of pro bono work in your immediate future. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"What are they doing? They're corporate lawyers, what do you think they're doing? They're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon. They're doing needlepoint. Push button battles. Push button wars. Armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won. No pain. No sound. No smell. One big, multinational circle jerk. You, on the other hand, you're on the slaughterhouse floor. You can't help but smell your clients. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Maybe I did. But don't get too cocky. No matter how good you are. Don't let them see you coming. That's the gaff, my friend -- make yourself small. Be the hick. The cripple. The nerd. The leper. The shit- kicking surfer. Look at me -- I've been underestimated from day one. Do I look like a master of the universe? That's your only weakness as far as I can tell. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"The look. The Florida stud thing. 'Scuse me, ma'am, did I leave my boots under your bed?' "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You know what you're missing? What I have? This beautiful girl she's just fucked me every way she knows how -- we're done -- she's walking to the bathroom -- she turns back -- and there I am. It's me. And she smiles -- it's like a veil coming down across her face -- and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen? And see, right there, from that moment on, she's got a secret. I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the whisper in Nefertitti's ear. I'm a surprise. They never see me coming. That's what you're missing. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Because I knew it was gonna be good. Because I knew I was gonna like it. That you would shine -- that we would take this walk -- that we'd really talk. Why I came down? You want the truth? I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat. I came up from nothing. From dirt. I'm warming my hands on your talent -- "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ, Where's the chicken? The chicken that plays tic-tac-toe. He used to be right here. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"(back to Kevin, as they walk) There's a chicken, he's famous, he plays tic-tac-toe. He never loses. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be executed. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,No. Exactly like that. It's faith. You're either in or out. You can't believe a little bit. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You're not here to amuse me. See, that's why people hate lawyers. So many of us have lost our faith. Don't let that happen to you. Token? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Learn the subways, Kevin. Use them. Stay in the trenches. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Mary Ann? John Milton... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You'd be surprised. There's a lot more fear in this room than you'd think. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Each other. Themselves.   Why? What scares you? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You'll figure that out. There's only one thing worth being frightened of anyway, and that's being alone. Truly and finally alone. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You know what terrifies me? Responsibility. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"For what. For you. Let's be honest, I've changed your life. Changed it forever. There's been a seismic shift in your existence and I'm responsible. And you've never even met me. We're talking for the very first time. How insane is that? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Kevin. Please. I'm not worried about Kevin. He buys a few new suits. Learns a few new tricks. He's there. I don't worry about Kevin. What about you? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You must have family. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Whoaa... I gotta think about that. I had you down as daddy's little girl, you know? The princess. Sugar plum snapshots. Pastel bedspreads. Cinnamon cookies. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,So you've got a lot at stake here. You've made a real commitment. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"It's not gonna be like Gainesville, but then you know that already. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"If it isn't, will you come to me? Let me help? I'd feel a lot less responsible. Will you do that for me? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"The worst vice is advice, right? But can I make a suggestion? It's about your hair, some people are sensitive, that's why I ask. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You have shoulders nobody can see. Pull it back. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"If I do it, everyone in this room that's pretending not to watch us will assume we're fucking or something. Pull back your hair. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique. And her neck, if she's alive, has the very mystery of a border town. It's the no man's land in the battle between mind and body. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I see the future of this law firm. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Look,   we gotta talk. You grab Heath   and Eddie Barzoon and get up to   my place right away. And let's   be quiet about it. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,How many hours did we bill Alex Cullen last year? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Alex Cullen has just been charged with murdering his ex- wife, her stepson, and a maid. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Just now. Tonight. I already sent Pam downtown to make bail arrangements. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,No.    I want Kevin on this case. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I've shaken hands with every marquee defense attorney in town. I take Kevin and I don't look back. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"I want you on board, Eddie. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,We can get this case.   The man's our client. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,We know him better than he knows himself. We have the inside track. We have the best damn trial lawyer in the city. It's ours to lose. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,No.    That's up to Kevin. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,That's Pam calling... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Alex, you know how this town works. You've got enemies you never heard of. And now? Now you're down? I'd prepare for a class-A, New York pig-fuck. You're going to have to ask yourself who you really trust. Who do you trust, Alex? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"He's a winner, Alex. And they'll never see him coming. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,The night is young. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Do it on the way. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"You write beautifully, Eddie. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Soon. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I don't micro-manage. You find the talent and then you delegate. Who knows what the hell Eddie's up to. He's got a lotta fingers in a lotta pies. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,No.    I can hear you just fine. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ, I'm not going anywhere. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ," Maricela, the moment you left the apartment she was upstairs with Carlos. They're on the pipe right now, my friend. They're in the kitchen splitting a jumbo and then he's going to fuck her in the ass, right on your bed, and she's going to like it. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ, Do yourself a favor and put that knife where it belongs. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"I told him if he didn't leave us alone, you were going to kick all three of their asses. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You need a better lawyer. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Hang on a second... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I was just telling the Moyez story. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,And is this your mother? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,John Milton.    Nice to meet you. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Mary Ann... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You've very welcome. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"She can't believe you're his mother. You've done one helluva job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax. I'm sure it wasn't easy. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Kevin, hang on... "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ, Why don't you come on up? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You sure? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I'm taking you off the case. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I want you to drop this case. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Do you love this woman? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Kevin, she's sick. Everyone will understand. I'll understand. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,We'll find someone new. You consult. You live to fight another day. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,It's a disappointment. We all have them. Embrace it. Use it. You move on. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"What's to talk? It's your wife, man. And she's very sick.    And that's gotta come first. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I guess you have thought about it. I stand corrected. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Was he drunk? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Eddie's gotten himself into trouble again. And he wants me to save him. And I can't. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Do you have any experience with manic-depression? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You do now. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Yes, it's me. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"I'll tell you, Kevin, because I know you're into theology. When you've seen -- when you've represented -- when you've dealt with as many people as I have over the years, finally you say to yourself, 'God must've been awfully bored.' "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I want you to put Eddie aside. Let me worry about it. You gotta deal with Cullen now. Marshal your strength. Prioritize. Conserve your energy. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,What choice do we have? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Because she didn't answer you fast enough? Did she lie to you? No. She said nothing. The fact is, you'll never know. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,You really believe that? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Look, you gotta go with your gut. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"I'll back you either way. Hey, you think I haven't lost before? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,... I don't make things happen. Doesn't work like that. Free will -- it's like butterfly wings -- one touch and it never gets off the ground. I only set the stage. You pull your own strings. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,A gun?   In here? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most depraved acts of sexual theater, one being an average Friday night run-through at the Lomax household, I'd say... "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Whoa... Got me! Damn! 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Never lost a case. Why? Why? Because you're so fucking good? Yes. But why? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Well, I'm a little more than that. Awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't it? 'What's the game plan, Kevin?' "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I have so many names. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Call me Dad. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Come on. You're not listening. Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope you're kidding. You could've saved her any time you liked. She only wanted love. But you knew it wouldn't really work out, didn't you? Mary Ann in New York? Face it, you started looking to better- deal her the minute you got here. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Hey, it's not that you didn't care for her, it's just you were a little bit more involved with someone else. Yourself. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Bio-chemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Who told you to pull out the stops for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez -- the direction you took -- Snake handlers, Popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough -- whose ideas were those? And then Cullen -- knowing he's guilty -- seeing those pictures -- putting that lying bitch on the stand... What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was time to lose, right? You didn't think so. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Exactly! 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,What do I want? I want you to be yourself! 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"I've had many children, Kevin. So many disappointments. Neurotic, indecisive wannabes. Over-eager, ham-handed butchers. Strung-out, priapic losers. And then there's you. Your mother, I'll tell you, she outstripped my wildest fantasy. That church she dragged you to? Every day? What training. What a challenge! It's awesome what you've done. How far you've come. Both of you... You and your sister. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Half-sister to be exact. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"What do you think, Kevin?    What a scene, huh? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Wait till you meet her mother. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"No. That's the other guy. I don't judge anybody. As far as I'm concerned, everyone's a winner. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"I'm here, on the ground, my nose in it since the whole damn thing began. Why? Because I worship man himself. And it's my time now. Our time. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Eddie was right. Your name is on the partnership charter. I want you to take over the firm. You and your sister. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,No. (letting his hand brush her cheek) She's ovulating. Right now. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"Your vanity is justified, Kevin, you're the seed to a new future. Your son will sit at the head of all tables. You hold a special place in the history of all things. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,I want a family. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Whatever... 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Free will. It's a bitch. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Are we negotiating? 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Yes! 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Everything. Anything. All of it! 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Don't be too hard on yourself. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"God, she's just fucking stunning, isn't she? "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Like that's wrong. Like there's anything wrong with that. That there could be laws preventing something so natural. That's our ticket in. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"We're coming out, guns blazing. The two of you -- all of us -- acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it reaches so high into heaven it chokes the whole fucking lot of them! What we cannot legislate we will buy. What we cannot buy we will degrade. We will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a vandalized, neon sign! And while God is busy at his peephole -- as he deigns us with his disapproval -- as he lumbers around his empty kingdom like some overfed colonial governor -- as God sleeps late, we will win. We've got a winner here, kids! "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Consider the source. 
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,"She's right, my son. It's time to step up and take what's yours. "
DEVILSADVOCATE,JOHNMILTON,ENTJ,Nooooooo...! 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I told her I would not grant one. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Yes. I did. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Yes. It does. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Yes. It does. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,It's the truth. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ," Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Hadn't planned on it. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,What was his name? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I was wondering if anyone knew his name. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,How do you know that? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I didn't, since you ask. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,What else have you heard? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,What do you think? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I understand you're a man who knows how to get things. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,You make your customers' motives a part of your business? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I have no enemies here. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Thanks for the advice. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, You'll know when you see the rock- hammer. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Ten it is. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Oh? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I understand. Thank you, Mr...? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"You get this in your eyes, it blinds you. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to hamstring you? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example... "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,No thanks. I gave up drinking. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Chess. Now there's a game of kings. Civilized...strategic... 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting a board together. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I'd like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz... the opposing side in limestone. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Years I've got. What I don't have are the rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Not yet. I suppose I should. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I suppose we are. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I'm innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"What are you in for, Red? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Innocent? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I know. I've seen it three times this month already. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Can we talk business? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Weeks? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I know. I've seen it three times this month already. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Can we talk business? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Weeks? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Okay. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Good evening. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"John. Chapter 8, verse 12. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"It's very pretty, sir. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"No, sir. Not especially. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I've been reassigned to you. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Brooks? How long have you been librarian? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"In all that time, have you ever had an assistant? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,So why now? Why me? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I see. Well. Why don't we have a seat and talk it over? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on your pay? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,He was right. You don't want your money in a bank. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"What's that gonna earn you? Two and a half, three percent a year? We can do a lot better than that. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I wouldn't say ""friends."" I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Maybe it can do more than that. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Ask the warden for funds. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter a week. They can't ignore me forever. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that. Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Take it easy. You'll be all right. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Red! 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,What is all this? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... "" "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Only took six years. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,They broke the door down before I could take requests. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Easiest time I ever did. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ," The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Like Brooks did? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Anniversary gift. Open it. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind. Wanted it to be a surprise. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,You gonna play something? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, ...Stevenson. Next? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right behind you. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Dumas. You boys'll like that one. It's about a prison break. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like always. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Very nice. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back... "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, I thought you had more faith in me than that. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Peter Stevens. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I work cheap. That's the trade-off. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I don't waste time on losers, Tommy. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing half-assed. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Well. You've come to the right place then. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"...and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! "" "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,That's right. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Well? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,May not be as bad as you think. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,We'll see how the score comes out. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away. Doesn't look back. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Sir? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I think he's telling the truth. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,They'd have his last known address. Names of relatives... 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club will have his old time cards! W-2s with his name on them! 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money! "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life? "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,I'm done. It stops right now. Get H&R Block to declare your income. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where I'd like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,You underestimate yourself. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel and that boat...I don't think it's too much to want. To look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ, ANDY 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,You'll just have to pry up that rock and see. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Just about done, sir. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Three deposits tonight. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,"Just about done, sir. "
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,My name is Peter Stevens. I've come to close out some accounts. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Thank you. I'm sure I will. 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail? 
SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION,ANDYDUFRESNE,INTJ,You look like a man who knows how to get things. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"• Well, if every man in this room does not end the evening completely in love with you then I am no judge of beauty. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Oh, they are far too easy to judge. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"And eat my hat. She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but • prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,So which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,And the person with the disagreeable expression? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Poor soul. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Thank you. It is the work of many generations. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Do you dance Mr Darcy? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Not if I can help it. Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following... "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not handsome enough to tempt me. Elizabeth's smile drops. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Don't worry. I would not dance with him for half of Derbyshire. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, BINGLEY 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• Yes! I adore her. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mama! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I thought that poetry was the food of love. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it is only a thin, slight sort of inclination, I'm convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely. Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of interest. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"So what do you recommend, to encourage affection? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones partner is barely tolerable. She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He has no idea she heard him. He blushes. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," Handsome, conveniently rich - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I agree entirely, only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony, which is why I will end up an old maid. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Jane, he danced with you most of the night. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"That is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise. Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very amiable, and I give you leave to like him. You've liked many a stupider person. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again. She blows out the candle. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's • babbling. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Though I don't think, mama, you can reasonably take credit for making it rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her death before she gets there. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"• ""And my kind friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better -- but do not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a. fever, and a headache there is nothing wrong with me."" This is ridiculous. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother. Mr Bennet laughs. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I am going to Netherfield at once. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Then I will walk there. We should not leave Jane alone in her condition. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I'm so sorry. How is my sister? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I think her concern for her sister does her credit. A little pause, Caroline recovers. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Jane! Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I have already told her once, by your desire. Lizzie looks across from her book. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, � Perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again. At present I have not enough room to do them justice. Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truely accomplished. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I do. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,And of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading. Elizabeth closes her book. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Are you so severe on your own sex? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold. Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over to 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"And it's a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose. Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline Bingley turns to Darcy. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ," You can only have two motives, Miss Bingley, and I would interfere with either. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Either you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking. If the first, I should get in your way. If the second, I can admire you • much better from here. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,We could always tease him. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider that a fault? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,That I couldn't say. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,For we're trying to find a fault in you. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others, or their offences against myself. My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"• Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that. What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Jane, do you think you might feel well enough to leave today? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town, which you must acknowledge to be true. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,(trying to stop Bingley being 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Thank you, Mary. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Darcy. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Miss Bennet. They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley waves enthusiastically to Jane. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," Please, drive on. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study? Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not to laugh at Mr Collins' answer. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be practised. The girls look at one another. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Oh no! Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Quick! This way! She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat, through the house and out the front. Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house. The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around, puzzled. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Kitty? Lydia! She and Jane join them. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, �  Then why don't you change them? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,So you don't mind being laughed at? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it not, to be aware of ones importance in the world. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," � You already owe me a considerable sum, Liddy. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,No! Please Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the counter. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,You're too generous. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,It all adds up. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr Wickham? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"About a month. Are you acquainted with, Mr Darcy? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"As much as I could ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house as him, and I think him very disagreeable. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I think I shall take a little air. She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony. As she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, ELIZABETH 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,How so? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself. But until he does, I hope never to encounter him. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"On the contrary, he is twice the man Darcy is. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"• No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor of the ball. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, � Have you seen Mr Wickham. She shakes her head. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Detained? Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at Elizabeth. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," ELIZABETH Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr Collins. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,That gentleman barely warrants the name. The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth is stunned. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,You may. Darcy walks away. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,What was I thinking? Have I no presence of mind?l 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all agreeable whom one is determined to hate! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I do love a Sarabande. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Indeed. Most invigorating. They continue, for a moment, in silence. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to • hear. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Do you talk as a rule while dancing? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I see no striking resemblance of your own character in this, how near it is to mine I cannot say.  Tell me do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Very mild weather we've been having. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Yes, we often walk to Meryton great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends retaining them is less certain. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I am. May I ask to what these questions tend. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"To make out your character, Mr Darcy. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,And what have you discovered? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,very little. The dancefinishes. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I hope to afford you more clarity in the • future. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing, "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I believe so. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,But sir - 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ," � ELIZABETH Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Aren't you going to do something? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• Yes. I think he likes her very much. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,She is just shy and modest. If he does not perceive her regard he is a fool. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mother. I really think it is time to go. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Really. This is enough. Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He turns and walks away. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me.that anybody need not hear. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Collins - 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, Mr Collins - 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Thank you, papa. Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"What's wrong, Jane? Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I don't understand. What would take him from Netherfield? Why would he not know when he was to return? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"""Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgina Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance and accomplishments, so much so I must hope to hereafter call her my sister. It is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self."" "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"• He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to our aunt and uncle's in London. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Thank you, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• What news? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Engaged? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No, no... "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,And that's all you expect? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,And we only have two choices? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You can still change your mind, Charlotte. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,All of them? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,It could not be worse. I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I have not heard from Mr Wickham since the regiment left for Brighton, but I am informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of all matters military that he does very well. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I am, your ladyship. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• Mr Darcy! What are you doing here? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire. Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap, introduces himself. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,• Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do? He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards Lizzie. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that. (looks at the girl, and whispers to charlotte) What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh yes, they should suit each other very well. Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has more at stake. 68 INT. DINING ROOM 9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen waiting, thousands of candles. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"They are, thank you. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"A little, ma'am, and very poorly. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No, not at all. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Not one. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,My mother would have no objection but my father hates London. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"We never had a governess. Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches Elizabeth, keenly. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," Not at all, Lady Catherine. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Yes, ma'am. All. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No, I beg you - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Please, I told you I play poorly - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,She plays very well. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all your state to hear me, but I won't be alarmed even though your sister does play so well. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I am well enough acquainted with you, Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you even should I wish it. A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam joins them. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• You really care to know? The colonel nods. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Prepare yourself for something very dreadful. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I do not have the talent of conversing easily with people I have never met before. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Maybe you should take your aunt's advice and practice. Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck. She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Please, do be seated. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,This is a charming house. I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first arrived. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I believe so -- and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him. Darcy sits down. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Shall I call for some tea? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"No. Thankyou. The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a pleasure. He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused and intrigued. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, ELIZABETH. I have no idea. 73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 73 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his disposal. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,She would be a lucky woman. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Really? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Darcy is a most loyal companion. From what I heard, on our journey here, he recently came to the rescue of one of his friends just in time. Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops, at the churchyard gate. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,What happened? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,He saved the man from an imprudent marriage. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,His closest friend. Mr Bingley. A silence. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,There were apparently strong objections to the lady. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,So he separated them? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I believe so. I know nothing else. Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is joined by his aunt. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards. Good morning, Col. Fitzwilliam. 76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76 parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a distance. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer ... . The past months have been a torment... He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in astonishment. He struggles on. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you...I had to see you... 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• Me? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"• I've fought against my better judgement, my family's expectation... "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I don't understand... 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Please do me the honour of accepting my hand. A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Yes, sir. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Are you laughing at me? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,No? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Are you rejecting me? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Might I ask why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus repulsed? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," I might as well enquire why, with so. evident a design of insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement. If I was uncivil, that was some excuse - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Believe me, I didn't mean - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"But I have other reasons, you know I have! "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,What reasons? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister? Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the face. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice, and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I do not deny it. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Because I believed your sister indifferent to him. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• Indifferent? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"• I watched them most carefully, and realized his attachment was much deeper than hers. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,That's because she's shy! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded that she didn't feel strongly for him. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Because you suggested it! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I did it for his own good. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,What was? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,It was made perfectly clear that-an advantageous marriage... 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Did my sister give that impression? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,No! An awkward pause. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"There was, however, I have to admit... the matter of your family - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"No, it was more than that. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"How, sir? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ," It pains me to say this, but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother, your three younger sisters occasion, your father. Forgive me. Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"You and your sister -- I must exclude from this... Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,And what about Mr Wickham? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Mr Wickham? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,What excuse can you give for your behavior to him? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,He told me of his misfortunes. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very great indeed! "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"So this is your opinion of me! Thank you for explaining so fully. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, if your pride had not been hurt - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,My pride? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,- by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish distain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time. He leaves, abruptly. Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, ELIZABETH I was caught somewhat off-guard. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting. Mr Collins clatters up the stairs. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I came to leave you this. He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth does not turn but watches him through the mirror. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I do not know. I hardly know myself. Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,How is Jane? Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,oh Jane... 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Nothing. Everything as you might imagine. Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and Mrs Bennet. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Kitty, what's happened? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Please Papa, don't let her go! "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, Peace! Is that all you care about? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Father, its dangerous! - "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No wonder our family is treated with contempt. She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks puzzled at her outburst. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I don't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer, with your constant talk of men and marriages. Surely there is more to life. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they're amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No, they bring nothing but heartache. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,No. He did not. Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ," MRS GARDINER Well, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I would rather stay here. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am sure I will not be able to bear it. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I hear that Pemberley is not far from here. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You see something of the owner, do you, in town? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Only a little. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,• They are at home?! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Miss Bennet! Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches up with her. They both blush, deeply. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I thought you were in London. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,No. Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, And are you having a pleasant trip? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,• Tomorrow? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Yes. At the Rose and Crown. Another pause. She extends her hand. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea... She shakes his hand and starts to walk away. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,May I see you to the village? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Oh no! I'm very fond of walking. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Yes. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Goodbye, Mr Darcy. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,- I shall send my carriage at noon After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the table. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,His sister? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"My sister, Miss Darcy... They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,What a beautiful instrument. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,• Yes I should. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"She's easily persuaded, is she not? They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley approaches. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Yes, very. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I perceive no alteration' except she is rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even had I thought it, I would have couched it "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave. Darcy smiles at her. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I have recently thought a great deal about how I appear and act to others. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"It does you credit, sir. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Miss Elizabeth. She cries on. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,•  This is my fault Wickham when I should. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No, this is my fault. I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge. Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offer consolation to such distress. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Sir, it think it is too late. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye. Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and then is gone. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"He hasn't found him yet, Mama. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,How long is this going to go on for? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I can't bear not hearing anything. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Oh father, I'm so sorry. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,You mustn't be too severe on yourself. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Give it to me.  
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You will agree to this, father? The letter is passed around the other girls. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Ah, I see. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Do you think it a large sum? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"We should thank our uncle, Mama. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Is that all you think about? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I don't want to hear - 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Can't you understand why? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Darcy was at your wedding? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Very much. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Please, Lydia! "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Everything? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,But why did he do it? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I have some business with Mr Bingley. Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has wronged Jane Bennet. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,That is the consequence of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Do you hope to stay long in the country, Mr Bingley? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Are you well, Mr Darcy? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Quite well, thank you. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for your sport. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I return to town tomorrow. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,What were you thinking of? It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and down. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ, ELIZABETH 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,How did he account for it? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Unfathomable. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Bravo! That is the most unforgiving speech you've ever made. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time. What is that? More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each other. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Lady Catherine! Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast Bennets. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Indeed you are mistaken. I can not account for this honour at all. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"If you believed it impossible, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I have never heard of it. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask the questions, which I may not choose to answer. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Only this have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I am not. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Darcy! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,What are you doing out here so early? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,I could not sleep. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,Me neither. I have been up.most of the night. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa. Everyone is stunned. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"No, Papa. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP, I do like him! 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP," No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't want it. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"• Very much. He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no doubt. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,Oh thank you! She starts to rush out. 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"Allow me, Mrs Darcy. He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,How did it begin? 
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"Now be sincere, did you admire me for my impertinenc? "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,FITZWILLIAMDARCY,INTJ,"For the liveliness of your mind, I did. "
PRIDEANDPREJUDICE,ELIZABETHBENNET,ENFP,"You may as well call it impertinence, though make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate - them as much as possible. And, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe... and I shall begin directly... We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter and fainter, the sound of music and laughter... "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ," Thank you, Grandmama. In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Gomez... the sun... il me perce comme un poignard. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Gomez? 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Last night, you were... unhinged. You were like some desperate, howling demon. You frightened me. Do it again. Gomez, instantly aflame. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," The little ones, off to school. Bless them. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Too fast. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Imagine, Darling, if Fester did come back. Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell... "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," It's over, darling your sister? "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Gomez? 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Oh, Mama, I was sure we'd find her here. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Fester adores Gomez! 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, But he isn't even Uncle Fester. Gomez and Morticia turn to look at her. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Just as long as we're together, n'est pas, mon cher? As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow -- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated plastic and orange shag carpet. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," That's the soap, dear. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ," Do you want a cigar, Father? "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," We are Addamses, and we will not submit. Who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare? The swift, yet lazy little cottontail, and his slow but determined companion? What does that story teach us, as Addamses? "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, Put the tortoise on the highway. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Yes! We will survive! Poison us, strangle us, break our bones - we will come back for more. And why? "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Private tutors. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Spells and Hexes. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Well, one day each week I visit Death Row at our local prison, with my children. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Autographs. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, He's... he's going through a bad patch at the moment. But it's not his fault. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, Yes. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, Are they made from real girl scouts? 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," ... and so the witch lured Hansel and Gretel into the candy house, by promising them more sweets. And she told them to look in the oven, and she was about to push them in, when, low and behold, Hansel pushed the poor, defenseless witch into the oven instead. Where she was burned alive, writhing in agony. Now, boys and girls, what do you think that feels like? After a beat, all the toddlers begin to CRY and WAIL. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, I know The whole family. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ," If that man isn't Uncle Fester, then who is he, mother? "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," I don't know, darling.   I wish I did. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, Why is that lady doing all this? 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, It's hard to say. Sometimes people have had terrible childhoods. And sometimes they just haven't found their special place in life. And sometimes they're dogs from hell and must be destroyed. Morticia kisses Wednesday and she closes her eyes to go to sleep. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Stop it, you two. Morticia breaks free of Thing. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, I would like to speak with Fester. Tully steps aside. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," (graciously, with understanding) Tully Alford Parasite. How Gomez adored you. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Dear Fester Which is the real you under-handed monster you've become? Or the loathsome, underhanded monster we came to love? "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Fester window. I know it was you. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Mon cher! 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Darling, take care! "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, As does mine. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Our wheel. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Quickly, my darling! He helps her down from the wheel. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Later, my dearest. ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, But what of Fester? 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Oh yes 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," Hello, Margaret. Cousin It almost didn't recognize you. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, Children begging in the streets. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," That unfortunate woman. Filled with evil. (shaking her head, sadly) But not enough. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ, From the Bermuda Triangle. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, How true.   Stranger things have happened. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, And just as refreshing. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Of course 
ADDAMSFAMILY,WEDNESDAYADDAMS,INTJ," No, mine! "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," (touched by the brothers devotion) And just as refreshing. Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly handshake. "
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, We'll catch up. Fester runs out. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ, Gomez? Morticia holds up the garment she's been knitting a BABY JUMPER WITH THREE LEGS. 
ADDAMSFAMILY,MORTICIAADDAMS,INFJ," (shaking her head ""yes"") Oui, mon cher... They embrace, as the front door SWINGS OPEN, of its own accord. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I can't sleep nights. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I know. I tried that. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Clean. Real clean. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Also clean. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Some. Here and there. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Honorable discharge. May 1971. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, I want long shifts. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,So I hear. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,No. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Yes, Sir. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Why should it be grounded? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Then it's a good guess it's grounded. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Have you tried the telephone? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,No. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,What is your name? My name is Travis. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, I'm serious, really... "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,That's fine. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, TRAVIS Hey Wizard. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just heard it on the radio. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up.  Just heard it on the radio. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, just some crazy fucker. Cut have his ear off. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,In the jungle. 122nd. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, WIZARD 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Huh? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, I have. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Nah. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, I want to volunteer. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, No. I want to volunteer to you. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Who mam? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Yes, mam. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's right. People should work for a living. I do. I like to work. Every day. Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," BETSY Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,My name is Travis. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, ""One of these days I'm Gonna Organezizied"". "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I can believe that. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Yeah, well... "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Just people people, you know. Just people. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said ""West 45th Street"" and conked out. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I know. I could have picked you up. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Late one night. About three. At the plaza. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I work a single, which means there's no replacement man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, it keeps ya busy. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,What? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Oh. Who was that again? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Damn straight. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," He'll, what else can I do with it all? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,No. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, I bought a couple of tickets. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Damn. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I forgot to get the Coca-Cola. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Where are you going? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,What do you mean? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, I don't follow movies too much... "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,This is sort of high class... 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Well... mostly... 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty... "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"... there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, You mean you don't want to go to a movie? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Huh? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,But... Betsy... 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, What about the record? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Can I call you? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Please, Betsy, I bought it for you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,But I got a taxi. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, you feeling better? You said you didn't feel so good... 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I'm off duty. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, I'm off duty. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,It was on. (gesturing toward top of taxi) it just takes a while to warm up. Like a TV. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,20 bucks? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Travis and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel. Dough-Boy pulls away. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,You got a .44 Magnum? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I got money. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I want a .32.   Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,How much for everything. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,How much to get a permit to carry? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Nah, this'll be fine. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Is there a firing range around? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Huh? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Huh? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Nah. I ain't interested. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Hey 'Melio. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Hey dude! 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"You're gonna have to cover me on this one, 'Melio.  I can't stay for the cop show. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"The hell I can't.  It's no sweat for you.  What is this for you, number five? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Thanks a lot. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Damn, damn. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Slow. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Hey Wiz, just a second.  I wanna talk to you. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Hey Wiz. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Wiz? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me... "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, I just, you know... "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Real down. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  I get some real crazy ideas, you know?  Just go out and do somethin. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Yeah. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Like do anything, you know. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Neither do I, I guess. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Thanks. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Are you a Secret Service Man? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I've seen a lot of suspicious- looking people around here today. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Oh, lots.  I don't know where they all are now.  There used to be one standing over there. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I kinda thought I might make a good one.  I'm very observant. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I was in the Army too. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"You would, huh? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a ""K."" K-R-I-N-K-L-E.  I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey.  Zip code 07410. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Great, hey.  Thanks a lot. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Sorry, officer. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, officer. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Hello. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Well...I guess so. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,You name Sport? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Your name Sport? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I'm no cop. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Shit. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I'm no cop. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I'm hip. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Why you hang around with them greasers? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Yeah.  From the likes of them. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,What's your name? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,That ain't much of a name. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,What's your real name? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, What's your real name? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,That's a nice name. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Don't you remember me?  Button your shirt. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I drive a taxi.  You tried to get away one night.  Remember? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,It don't matter.  I'm gonna get you outta here. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, I don't want to make it.  I came here to get you out. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Can't you listen to me?  Don't you want to get out of here? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, But you're the one that wanted to get away.  You're the one that came into my cab. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Do they drug you? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Listen... 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, I want to help you. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it! 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Don't you understand anything? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Do you understand why I came here? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Don't you want to go? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,But that one night? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, I tried. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Can I see you again? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"No, I mean really.  This is nothing for a person to do. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a... 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," O.K. It's a date.  I'll see you here, then. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"So long, Iris. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Here's the twenty bucks, old man. You better damn well spend it right. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Where is home? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Where? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,But you can't live like this.  It's hell.  Girls should live at home. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Young girls are supposed to dress up, go to school, play with boys, you know, that kinda stuff. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy.  I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"That fella ""Sport"" looks like a killer to me. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Huh? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,He looks like a killer. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,He shoots dope too. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,He's worse than an animal.  Jail's too good for scum like that. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I never been to a commune.  I don't know.  I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Me?  I could never go to a place like that. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, I... I don't get along with people like that. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Besides, I've got to stay here. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I've got something important to do. I can't leave. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Do I look like a narc? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,You just gonna leave 'em? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Cops don't do nothin. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls.  You should get rid of them. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," I don't know.  Just should, though. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," I'm sorry, Iris.  I didn't mean that. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful.  And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out.  And they hate it.  So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all.  So I don't say a thing.  I pretend I'm not even there.  I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you.  You have to get away from here.  The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"I can't.  Otherwise, I would. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I'll give you the money to go.  I don't want you to take any from those guys. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I want to -- what else can I do with my money? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,My work may take me out of New York. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," TRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an envelope. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Hey, Sport.  How are things? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I'm here to see Iris. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Yeah, Iris.  You know anybody by that name? "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, You carry a gun? 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Get it. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Show it to me. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Now suck on that. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Pgghew!  Pgghew! 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Hey Charlie T. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Shit. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Hello, Betsy. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,I see where Palantine got the nomination. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Well, I hope he wins. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,"Oh, I got over that.  It was nothing, really.  The papers always blow these things up. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP,Here we are. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP," No, no, please.  This fare's on me. Please. "
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, TRAVIS Yeah. 
TAXIDRIVER,TRAVISBICKLE,ISTP, Sure. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," This is Constantine. John Constantine, asshole. The girl JOLTS, bandages on her arms cut into her skin. Eyes snap open -- glare right through him. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, How ya doing? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Let's see who we got here... He holds them up so they cast shadows across Jeanie's face. He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS until the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look away. John stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely puzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I need a mirror. Now. Shaken, the Mother produces a small compact.   John pushes it away, turns to the doorway crowd. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, A large mirror. At least -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery HOOKS EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window, looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is parked. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Chaz? CHAZ  looks up from his cab. Cool. Frustrated. You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Move the car. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind from the flesh I command thee -- The girl chokes as if ready to spit. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, That's it -- time to go home. Jeanie SCREAMS -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Amar natash bow basar -- Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon inside were trying to burst right through. John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances to Hennessey. What the hell? MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM. John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Hennessey, tie it off -- Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above him. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Now close your eyes -- all of you -- and whatever happens -- do not look into the mirror. The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the weight. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind from the flesh I command thee! Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young body all out of proportion. John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young girl in there, but something else. The surface of the mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to look -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," No! Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, JOHN 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Look!   Look at me! But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Goddamit -- look! -- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Smile pretty you vain prick. The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in. MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Now, Hennessey. Now! Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, For your boss. Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion. Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, No you don't. John jumps up and helps push the mirror free. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Hennessey. Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the exit. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I'm not back an hour and you drag me into -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Don't do that shit on me -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I should take it all, save you from yourself. He gestures that bagged BOTTLE in Hennessey's jacket. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I told you to move it. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Well what? Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Los Angeles... He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Never ceases to entertain. Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Make two trips? John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You're not my slave, Chaz. You're my very appreciated assistant. Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend. Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand- marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of place. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Well I don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of Hell? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish? Chaz sighs, starts out -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Chaz...? Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, A little something from Delphi. It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow. Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What can I say, Beeman, India was a real drain. They shake hands.     Beeman sets his bowling bag onto the table, unzips it. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Everything you got. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Maybe. Incubus in this girl I just exorcized seemed a bit more spirited than usual. Beeman starts pulling things out.      First is a frayed RAG. Then glass containers... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What is it with you and bugs? Beeman pulls out a set of sculptured BRASS KNUCKLES. Actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings. John takes them, tries them on. Nice fit. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I thought you couldn't get it anymore. Beeman shrugs, modesty. John starts to put it down on the table and Beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Got any callinicus? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I know how it sounds... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Check the scrolls anyway. Corinthians. See if there are any precedents. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Two frogs on a bench. Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him -- he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Numquam leadatur a morsu. A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors don't budge. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Bastard changed the code again. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Deciding which color to paint this place again? PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office. Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A full six and half feet of solid contradictions. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I got tired of spending your money. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Well I do have a certain standard of living. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I found the vault. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Hey, can I help it if Buddhist monks don't take bribes? Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from his pocket a small ebony and gold RELIC. It stops Midnite cold. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Gotcha. A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a cosmic wind. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Right.    So we good here? Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the Universal orrery. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, That damn thing's never going to balance. Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts to move. To turn. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," It's authentic, Midnite, you just have the wrong piece. Jesus... The two have a mini stare-down. John's rigid poker face is only broken by a cough. Midnite sighs, breaks it off. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, What? -- I didn't blink -- that was a cough. You never cough? Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a thick stack of HUNDREDS. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Better not be any Washingtons in here this time. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I don't know... Just a feeling -- John suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned to see -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Balthazar. Balthazar is behind him.     Utterly confident.     Chillingly so. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I'll make your night -- I'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, John stops in his tracks. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, It's bad enough that you let these half-breeds in at all but this piece of shit -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What?! Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Not while I'm still breathing -- John starts to cough again. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I don't hate you. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, But could you at least wait until I call for you before you show up? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out sometimes. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, No. I've got an assignment for you. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, The kind you'll have to be sober for. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Come on, you know that exorcism wasn't right. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Don't have it or don't want to use it? Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Just look around. A few days. You spot anything unusual, anything -- you let me know. Okay? John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy, then reaches behind his neck -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, It'll be like old times. -- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's pocket. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Just for a few days. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," No -- I've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think I'm going to be done in by THIS? He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER  sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," It can't be that simple. I mean come on, Les, you saved me before. You can do it again, right. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, That's because I know exactly where I'm going this time. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Not if I can help it. The doors close right on Angela. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, As if you guys didn't have something to do with it... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I don't know, something in the air -- She sits right on his lap, playfully. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Not this time, Ellie. John lifts her off of him, sets her aside. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Yeah, I thought maybe you could talk to him for me. You know...? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, So I take that as a 'no?' 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I'm starting to see his point. Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I'm sure I can get you in here. Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter flag back down. Tick... tick... tick... "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," No thanks, I'm not staying long. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," First come, first served. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Been keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have you? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," So you're going to make me beg? Angela pauses on her way out, looks over. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What about the minions I've sent back, the souls that I've saved -- that should guarantee my passage across -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, This is bullshit -- bullshit! Now he's really got Angela's attention. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," It's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do -- help an old lady across the street -- put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime -- you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here! "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," And you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us -- You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us -- This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Gift?! More like a curse the way you manage things. Gabriel stands and towers over John. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Why me, Gabriel? It's personal, isn't it? I didn't go to church enough? I didn't pray enough? I was five bucks short in the collection plate? Why? Gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, He has a rotten sense of humor. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," A few months, maybe a year. That's it. End of story. Game over. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, This bastard attacked me right out in the open -- on Sepulveda no less. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," That's just it -- this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon. Here. On our plane. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I know what I saw. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I didn't cross over -- It was on this side. Here. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Emotional?! John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost lost. Midnite glares at a desperate John. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," It's more than that... first the girl, then this. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Something's coming. Midnite sighs, gives up with him. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Welcome to my life. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, -- I remember. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Yeah. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I'm not really in the talking mood right now. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Always a catch... Angela sits across from him, puts the badge away. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Sorry to hear... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Never met her. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, She look anything like you? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I thought you said she was murdered? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You'd be surprised at what people will do. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Sounds like a theory.   Good luck. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Yeah, okay.   Sure. John points -- toward the exit.      Angela is not amused. But she's not giving up. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, -- she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Oh shit... He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks the glass over. Spider runs free. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, How open is your mind? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Do you believe in Heaven and Hell? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Hey! 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," And demons. Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," See, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work. They walk together down the lonely street. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy. Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Then sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You should.   They believe in us. They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then blacks out. Both look up. The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT. Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, We should go... Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Fast. Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural WIND races toward them. John jerks her into action. They run towards the next light. It blinks out right when they reach it. They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Wings. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, And maybe talons. The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Something that's not supposed to be here. John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand. Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get CLOSER -- ghastly sound of MOVEMENT in the fringes of light. The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with every second the circle of light gets smaller and those SOUNDS GET CLOSER. John takes out his special lighter. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Close your eyes. They are now standing in pitch darkness. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Suit yourself. John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion -- sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand. Sacred cloth catches fire -- then IGNITES with a brilliant retina-searing FLASH -- blinding Angela and illuminating a -- -- CIRCLE OF WINGED DEMONS -- a roiling broth of reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," They weren't angels. John scans the area, trying to think this through. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Seplavites, actually. Scavengers for the damned. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Yeah... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You really believe she wouldn't commit suicide? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Let's be sure. He starts walking.     Angela is now compelled to follow. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Simple.   See if she's in Hell. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, The cat too? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I need you to step outside now. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Angela?   Please. Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a moment where animal and man seem to connect. The water around John's feet begins to BOIL. ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on its way to latch. Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers, is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John has now crossed over into -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Is she here? On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut through the putrid brown haze. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Is she here?! His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, It's a simple question!    Is she here or not?!! John suddenly locks on something far off. On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows she's looking right at him. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Isabel? She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Tea. She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the table by the window. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," My parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a priest. I was in four different institutions by the time I was eighteen. Angela notes him rubbing his wrist. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, The last place they put me was run by a church... A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, So I took things into my own hands and I found a way out. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I never attempt anything. John's reflection in the window becomes -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Not my doing. His chest suddenly HEAVES forward -- and we're on... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," So when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul -- I deport their scaly ass right back to Hell. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Well, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you? Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Not for me. John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at him -- finally -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Shit... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, So you put her in here. Angela doesn't need to be reminded.     It hurts even more now. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Show me her room. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You were twins. Angela nods, steps inside.      John pauses, thinking. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, So how long? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You don't walk off a building without leaving something behind. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Maybe she left something else. Something more personal. Just for you. Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You were her twin, Angela.    Twins tend to think alike. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," But you were at once time. When you were kids. When you'd spend every waking hour with each other. You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd cry. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, That kind of bond doesn't just disappear. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," She planned her death in this room, she thought it up right where you're standing -- Angela backs away.     John advances. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," She knew you'd come -- She counted on you to see what she saw, to feel what she felt -- to do what she did. What did she do, Angela? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What did she do, Angela? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, What would you do? Angela backs into a wall.       Nowhere else to go now. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What would you leave her? What would it be? Where would it be?! Where would it be? Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating. John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Corinthians. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I need a church. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of Ethenius. It's like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Depends on which side of the fence you're standing. John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl of holy water near the altar. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Because it doesn't exist here on this side. John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Symbol isn't a demon's... that's why I couldn't place it... not a normal possession... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, But he can't cross over -- impossible for the son to cross over... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, No.  The other one. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," But unlike his old man, he's never been in the presence of the Creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either. That goes double for us -- God's most prized creations. Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Unless they found a bridge. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," But even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God. Angela sits back, letting that sink in. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Impossible? Sure it's impossible. That's what makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Makes sense to me. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Beeman? John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's locked from the other side. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," He's always here. Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices, turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots them as well. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Oh Jesus, no -- He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged. Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Who are you?! Answer me!! Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I summon you! He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating -- Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Into the light I command thee!! Into the light I -- John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela just how ill he really is. She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, ... this is my fault... I sent them in... I sent them right to their deaths... a damn one-man plague. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I've seen a goddamn doctor!! Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying. John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Get away from me!! 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, JOHN 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Go home, Angela. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Because you open up to that world, you're inviting whatever's out there back in. That's what happened to Isabel. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," No, she embraced her gift while you denied yours and that denial is exactly why you're still alive. Stick with me, that'll change. John gets off the window, starts walking away. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, And I don't need another ghost following me around. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You do this, there's no turning back. You see them -- they see you. Understand? Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, JOHN  
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, JOHN  
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, It's the universal conduit. Lubricates the transition from one plane to another. Now ask me if there's water in Hell. John turns off the faucet. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Sit. Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself. When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Normally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Lie down. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You have to be fully submerged. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," As long as it takes.     Here -- John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Last chance... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Angela? Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out. John pries himself from the tile, goes after her. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Balthazar. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, That half-breed tipped my scales when he started killing my friends. I'm just adding a little counterweight. John lifts that holy shotgun -- KA CHICK -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Think of it as a bulletproof vest. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," How's he doing it? John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is burned off, but now he's pissed. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Screw the Balance. John hits him with another BLAST of FLAME -- pins him hard against the wall. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," How's he doing it, you half-breed shit?! John swings the flame aside so he can KICK Balthazar against the wall. But now his WEAPON SPUTTERS. Shit. Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and grabs John by the throat. Balthazar rises from the ashes.     He may be burned, but he's one tough son of a bitch. Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't break his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages through his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred GOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand. Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him across the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying ripple throughout Balthazar's body. But he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling on him. Again and again -- each punch weakening this demon more. John finally gets him against the wall. Right arm's tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand, and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away. Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of death. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Not really, no. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, True.   But you're not. John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat. Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses -- A Bible. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I'm reading you your last rites. Balthazar reacts.      This isn't good. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Aren't you half human? Balthazar doesn't have to answer. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You see, that makes you eligible to be forgiven. You do know what it is to truly be forgiven? To be welcomed into the kingdom of God? Balthazar's worst nightmare. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, A demon in heaven -- love to be a fly on that wall... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," -- I escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do that?! Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole. Balthazar isn't convinced. John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 'May the merciful God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins...' He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding authority. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from -- ' 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, How?   How's he doing it?! Balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, How? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, He's found the Spear. Balthazar's expression confirms it. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, What happened to staying in the car? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Well now there's a premonition. SIRENS crack the air.     Angela jumps in and John PEELS 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, He was finished off by a soldier's spear. He points in the Bible at a detailed painting of the event -- Jesus hanging on the cross -- being pierced by a soldier's spear. It matches that child's drawing John removed from the fridge -- now lying on his seat. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Then you know what this spear would mean to a demon trying to cross over. She doesn't. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," The stains on its edges? Angela looks back at the painting, notes the liquid flowing from Jesus' wound. Angela can't believe it -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Mammon needed divine assistance -- how's the blood of God's only son? Angela sits stunned for a moment. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Not quite. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Here we go -- John floors it and Angela glances out the back window, spots something in the traffic -- bounding over vehicles, hitting the pavement on all fours -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," A hound on the hunt. A blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible speed -- denting in roofs, CRACKING a WINDSHIELD -- causing general chaos. Cars brake -- SLIDE into each other. And still this thing keeps coming. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Hang on -- BARRACUDA slides into an alley, races toward the other end. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, He's not down.   Gimme your phone. Angela pulls out her cellular. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Chaz -- where are you?! 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You still got that Sedrallus? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save my ass here! "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Remember the Chalic of Enook incident? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," West side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say... He checks the speedometer -- 90 mph. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, ... 2 minutes. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Of course he's gaining. John PUNCHES the GAS to the floor. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Where's the amulet? WHAM -- something reaches through the roof hole and JERKS HER right out of the car. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," We're even. Chaz nods and John leaves him at the rail.   He jumps back in the BARRACUDA and PEELS OUT. Chaz watches him race away, looks back at his burning taxi. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, And this time he might just make it. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, And the bridge. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You don't know her. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Where's the chair? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, The delicate little number from Sing Sing? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I'll take my chances. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Midnite -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Midnite -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Where the hell is the chair, you dumb shit?! Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's seven feet. John knows he went too far. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," That was the cancer talking, you know that, right? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," What's in your bathroom, a Renoir? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Like riding a bike... He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Then just increase the juice. John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, I just need enough rope to find her. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," One goddamn problem at a time -- John shoves past him, plops his ass in the huge chair. His feet dangle off the ground. Midnite stands by, won't help. So John starts strapping himself in the chair. His chest, his ankles. One wrist. He obviously can't strap the other. He looks to the big man. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You want me to sign a waiver? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Hang on, Angela. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Try? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Roach wings? What happened to using lilac pedals -- ? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Ravenscar. The abandoned wing. He's in the boy. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," That ritual you do with the water, can you do more than one bottle at a time? Midnite raises an eyebrow. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Okay -- let's cut the scratch and call it a night. Meeting's over. That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Ellie? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You think his son will be any different? He'll just turn this place into his own Hell and then where will you to party, Heaven? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Never bothered you before. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I'm sure you will. John pulls out his lighter, holds it up -- flicks it on. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Now turn around and take your friends with you. Can he look more ridiculous? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," I will deport you.   All of you. You know I can. John steps back up onto a chair, thrusts the lighter higher -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Go to Hell. Ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," We are what we are, Ellie -- John FIRES over his back, loosens her grip. He grabs hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead sprinkler head. Legs flail about. Midnite comes out of the rain -- grabs John. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Let her up!!   Let her up!! A beat as John meets Barry's eyes -- realizes he's staring at a frightened child. Barry backs away as -- -- Angela sits up behind John.    Water rippling off, straps dangling free. John turns -- locks on her BLACK EYES. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Shit -- John thinks fast -- scans the area and sees every mirror in the room has been shattered. So much for the quick fix. He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and pushes her against the tank walls. This is an exorcism on the fly. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Amar natash bow basar! Rescind from the flesh I command thee -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Back to Hell, asshole -- Her body undulates as Mammon's shape tries to come through. Pulsating through her arms, her chest -- her face. Angela BITES into his palm. John recoils. She shoves him off and John hits the tile hard. Angela jumps from the tank, pushes past in a blur. John spins to see Midnite standing right there -- Angela now firmly in his size-twelve grasp. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Into the light I command thee! Into the light I command thee! It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes that familiar shape of WINGS. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Gabriel? John is too weak to even be surprised anymore. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Figures... Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, And the wicked shall inherit the Earth. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call me provincial. "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good thinking... Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," So what's a few thousand years of pain, right? "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, And that just bugs the shit out of you. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You're trying to teach us a lesson? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Hurry... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You're early. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, So I've heard. Satan sees John's slit wrists. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, ... so how's your son? 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, ... he's topside... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, With Gabriel. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, He's helping your son create his own Hell on Earth... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, He has the Spear of Destiny. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Go look for yourself... Satan is still suspicious. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," You've waited twenty years for me, what's another twenty seconds? Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time -- "
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Isabel... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, ... let her... go home... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, Human... Gabriel looks up as John retrieves a gun from the wet floor. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You don't deserve to be human. 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, ... and I'll be condemned again... 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP, You're even worthless as bait. John starts to turn away -- 
CONSTANTINE,JOHNCONSTANTINE,ENTP," That's called pain.    Get used to it. John turns toward the double doors -- stops cold. Huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is Angela and Barry. The experience has obviously left them both drained. John walks across the room, kneels down to them. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay. 8. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Yes, sir.    I sure do. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Are you sure? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Hey... Patrick. 12. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,My dad's building it. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No.   I'll sit if that's okay. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"So, uh... you like football? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Then, maybe you know my broth-- "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Is that what they call him? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I think The Smiths are my favorite. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I could make a copy for you. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, Yeah. They're great. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,That's okay. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey... maybe I'll see you around in school? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Okay.   Bye. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,What are you doing? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Are you sure it's okay that I come? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Is that Brad Hays? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,But he's a popular kid. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Have you guys felt this carpet?     This carpet feels so darn good. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I just really want a milkshake. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself. You know what I mean? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"What a great word. Milkshake. It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Oh, he shot himself last May. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,25. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, BRAD HAYS 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I didn't see anything. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"""Like a cake."" That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Our little secret.     Agreed. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I look forward to that big talk. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,What did I do? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,27. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Never. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,What is she doing? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I feel infinite. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Hey.    Are you okay? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You can take them again. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'll help you study for the next one. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Yeah, of course. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so-- "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Really? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Can we make them know they deserve more? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You want to work on probabilities and statistics? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Thanks. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Thanks. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"You too, Mr. Anderson. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Where's Craig? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Sorry. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You got me clothes?     Why? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Can you hand these out while I'm gone? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Where are we going? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Is this your room?    It's so cool. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You got me a present? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I don't know what to say. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You are. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, No. 43. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Well, it hasn't worked so far. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No.   What about you? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, No! Your first kiss... 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Was he your first boyfriend? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,It's true.     You can do it. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"My Aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life around. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,She was my favorite person in the world... until now. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I love you, too. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Have a good time at your mom's. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Thank you, Patrick. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP," Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug. As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet... "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Hey. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,How are you liking school? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Okay?    You're playing in a Bowl Game. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Good. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,How long does this take to work? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then 49. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP," Not, uh... Not really. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,It was a Christmas present. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Did you have fun on your break? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,But they said in health class-- 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Are you sure? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,That'd be great. Thanks. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,The one where the girl asks the guy. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You want to go with me? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Are you having a good time? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'm sorry Craig didn't come. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I don't know. If you like it, he should come. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'll try not to make you too jealous. 56. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,This is sure a nice house. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,This merlot is really fancy. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I guess.    Where are your parents? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,That's sure a nice fire. 57. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Is it? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, CHARLIE Uh-huh? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Uh-huh. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I think so. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP," She gives him one last kiss.      Content, she lays down on his lap. Peaceful. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I know. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,60. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I can do that? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Truth. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Dare. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm-- "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,64. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do anything. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, Oh. Okay. How long do you think? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'll... I'll be there in a minute. 65. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I know. I just feel really bad about what I did. I just get so messed up inside like I'm 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I know. I'm sorry. I just.     We've all become such good friends-- 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Oh. Yeah. I mean I don't want to do anything to ruin our-- 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Okay.   I will. Goodbye, Mar-- "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Something's wrong with me-- 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No.   He told me to stay away. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, Why? Why? What happened? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Are you okay? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP," If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, CHARLIE Yeah? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Sure, Brad. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I don't know. I keep trying, but... I can't really remember what I did. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"So, you're not scared of me? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,And can we be friends again? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I'm just glad you're happy. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Sure, Patrick. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, It kind of is. It so is. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I don't know. 73. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Maybe. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I don't know. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Ew!   That's disgusting! 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade-- 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,And she let some of the boys feel them. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No. 74. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Fine!    Okay. Your turn. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I don't know. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,It's alright. 75. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this time. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided... are you going to New York? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah.   Yeah. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP, Really? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You're the best teacher I ever had. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Yeah? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,We accept the love we think we deserve. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I just want you to be happy. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I know who you are, Sam. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Oh, ah... nothing. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Stop crying. 86. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Stop crying. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP," CHARLIE Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over. "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,And I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Where am I? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,You have to let me go.    My dad can't afford it. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No. I saw them when I was little. And I don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just tell me how to stop it. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Seeing it. All their lives. All the time. Just... how do you stop seeing it? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,There is so much pain.    And I don't know how to not notice it. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,What about her? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"Yes, she had a terrible life.   But... I mean, what am I... "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,I don't care. 90. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,She was... insane. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Okay. 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home... "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,"How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad? "
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,What do the players call a puck again? 
PERKSOFBEINGAWALLFLOWER,CHARLIEKELMECKIS,INFP,Definitely. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP, Willy-boy. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Wait-! 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"I'm sick of this, dad. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,How would you feel if you were one of them? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"Everyday, watching them stupidly walk into that killing pen. This isn't a normal kid's life. You won't even let me go to school. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Because I want to be in boring classes with other boring kids and draw pictures in text books and play baseball and go to dances and grind. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,So how's it work? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP, EDDIE The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Shit, I don't need a Bar Mitzvah for that. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Marie Claire. 10. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put on my 3-D glasses and it's like you're there. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Jesus, she's still here? "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What do you think she's thinking? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Yeah right, Dorsey Coen's been living in home ec these last three weeks. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,They're not going to find him. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Sure they will. In a ditch. All decomposed, covered in worms and maggots and smelling like your MOM'S-- "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Soooo, you gonna let me go by or is there a secret password or something? "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Sorry. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"""Sorry""'s not much of a password. Now ""kittyhawk,"" that's a good one. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Ballyhoo? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Riproar. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Barnburner. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"If you're worried about Bowers and his merry band of a-holes hassling you, don't. I saw them all leave out front. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Thanks. 13. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,You're the new kid right? I'm-- 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP, Beverly Marsh. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP, I slipped in the shower. What's your excuse? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,I fell on three boxes of donuts. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Well, see ya around Ben from sosh class. ""Get laid in the shade."" "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Uh, you too, Beverly. ""Stay cool."" "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,K.I.T. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Hi Mom. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Ma'am. 15. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Eddie-bear? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Yes, ma. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,The Miss America of cute boys. Seriously. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Bye ma. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,I like it in here. It's-- 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP," I'll try, Mrs. Starret. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have-- 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Yeah, Mommy? "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,What Mommy? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,No.    Why? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Yes, sir. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,I am. I'm taking this very seriously Rabbi. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Rabbi, I need to go pee. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,I... I. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,I should probably be getting back-

IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"You better quit, I swear. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want! 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,I DON'T-- 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,C'mon Eds get your ass down here and help. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,No way. There's sixty million diseases in that stream. It's gray water. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,What's gray water? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Tell `em Will. Your dad works for the public works. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm telling you guys you're splashing around in Derry's toilet. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Smells alright to me. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Whatcha got there Willy boy? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Son of a-- 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Sorry. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,What's the big deal? It's just a sneaker. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Shit. This isn't good, guys. This seriously isn't good. We should go. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,How do you think Dorsey feels? Running around these woods with only one friggin' shoe. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What if... he's still around here? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Dorsey! 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get in trouble. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,For what? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"I don't know. Disturbing evidence. Contaminating a scene. We should just mark where we found the shoe and leave an anonymous note to Chief Borton. My mom would have a major cow if she knew I was playing down here, I kid you not. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Shit, Eds you get within twenty feet of a peanut she has a whole herd. I don't want to think what she'll have if you come home with another kid's corpse. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"That's not funny, Richie. That's so not funny. Will, please. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Fine. You guys can do what you want but I'm going. I have no interest in seeing the muddy mangled body of SOME-- 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Holy friggin' Moses. What happened to you? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Heads up, homeschool! "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"Eat me, townie! "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Ben. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Thanks for helping me. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,You're not the only one on Bower's shitlist. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Woah, that's a lot of money. Will? "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,You crazy? My mom finds out I bought this stuff for myself I'll have to spend the whole weekend in the emergency room getting x-rayed. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Your friend there. He has that thingy he always carries around in his cute little fannypack right? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,My EpiPen Jr.? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Yeah. For when he spazzes out. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,I don't spaz. Those are allergic reactions. Life threatening allergic reactions. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Whatever. The point is he has a track record right? Of spazzing out. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,I DON'T-- 34. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I knew I shouldn't `a given him that granola. Mr. Keene! 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,My mom doesn't like me handling needles. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Thanks, Mr. Keene.   That one was a real shit kicker. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Not bad for a bunch of amateurs. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Nothing. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Beverly was there? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Yeah. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,And she stole this stuff for me? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I don't think she even knows you're alive man. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"I think he means you, Big Ben. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,You're pretty friggin' hard to miss. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too? "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Will won't talk about it but the kid's arm got ripped clean off in a flash flood or something. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Well? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,What did he say? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,So let's get outta here. Police stations always make me feel guilty of something. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Later days. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Barrens? Don't fag out. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Is s-someone there? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Who are you? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"The bathroom! Daddy, in the BATHROOM-- "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,No... the sink... in the sink... 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,The sink... I was... I thought I saw a spider... 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Because you love momma? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,But we got a project we're working on out there. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"Dad, it's- "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Dad! 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy? "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Why is it all, like, people getting killed and missing kids and stuff? "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,I don't know. There's just a lot of that here. Been that way since the original settlers. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Derry started as a logging camp before it was officially on any maps. 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry. A month later they all disappeared, without a trace. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,The entire town? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"The people, the livestock, everything that was alive. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP, Aren't you supposed to be Jewish? 51. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something but there was no sign of an attack. The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Shit, maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries! "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,It was here. Right on the corner of what's now Witcham and Jackson. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Hey, isn't that where Will's brother, Georgie- "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"I don't know. It was just a way to kill time, I guess. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"It's summer, dorkus. If you're gonna kill time, do it right. 52. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Eddie? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Screw that. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,I'll go. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Ben, with those cuts you have on your chest, I'm not sure if getting in this water- "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Will you stop with the grey water shit. You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,What's grey water? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Don't get him started. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,What are you waiting for? Why don't you get in you pussy? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Very funny, Richie. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I thought so. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Haunted how? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Like any town, right? That's been around long enough, bad stuff is bound to happen. I mean, have you read the Torah? "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Have you been seeing ""things"" Will? "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Like.   In your dreams? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What did you see Will? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,The clown? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"I saw something, too. In the basement of the synogogue. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I need to show you guys something. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Isn't he at work? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Sometimes he comes home for a nap. 56. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What does he look like? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,In there. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,You'll see. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Oh God. Oh God. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,You really see it? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,It's like someone slaughtered a pig in here. Or a parent. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,The sink. It came out from the sink. My parents couldn't see it. I thought I was going crazy. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What's taking them so long? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,There was a lot of blood. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"All I'm saying is maybe there's some weirdo going around Derry dressed as a clown. You know, like the Joker in a ""Dark Knight"" comic. Some whack job who likes to dress up and kidnap kids. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Or blood in my sink? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"I don't know. Who knows how crazy people do things, right? "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I am now.    Thanks to you guys. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,I told you who chased me there. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"What happened, homeschool? "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,A clown. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Or sometimes it's something else. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Only us kids can see it. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,But we're not lying. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,But you adults aren't doing anything! 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Doctors say it's inside your bones. And spreading. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,I'll try. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,It's my fault. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"You're coming home though, right? "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,In case of what? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"Dad, I'm responsible. You don't need to tell me some long tale about drinking and driving or safe sex. I'll take care of things- "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Dad? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,What truth? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,What did you see? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Somebody! HELP! Let me out! 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,69. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Shut up. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Stop it. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,No! 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch dressing. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP, You call that a firecracker?    This is a firecracker. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Nice stick, Richie.     How about this. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,What? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"""IT."" 72. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I think it depends. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,On what? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Getting laiiiid. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Cuz blood always freaks a girl out. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Wow, you really don't know shit about girls do you? "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I didn't need to know that. 73. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Into one freaky looking clown you mean. That's the only form that seems to repeat. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Ironic right? Something that's suppose to make kids laugh, actually being super freaky. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,It makes sense though. If it's killing kids. A clown is the perfect cover. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Adults just ignore them. But kids, like your brother, Georgie... "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Home school. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,They're going to cream him. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,At least it won't be our problem for a night. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"That's cowardly, Stan. 74. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Beverly's right. We can't always hide from them. We need to do something. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,How? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,You nuts? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,We? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Fuck. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Abort? What does that mean. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Woah! 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Is that girl for real? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, Eddie and Stan charge from behind a hedge. Lighting bottle- rockets aimed at the car. Travis and his boys have to duck for cover as ONE of the rockets ZINGS through the car. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Holy hell. What kinda gear do they got? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Will, we need cover-- "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,The house. It's our only chance! 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,I don't think that's a good idea. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,When do you ever think anything is a good idea? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Really guys, there has to be another option. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,You want to swim?! 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,I'm serious. This house-- 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Rock, paper, scissors? "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,I'll go. 79. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,No.   I'll go. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP, Down here! 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,If we die here I just want to say that fight was friggin' awesome. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, We shouldn't be here. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP, You okay? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,It's just a scrape. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,They can't see the window? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, We shouldn't be here. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Don't count your chickens. 81. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Something wrong with your friend here? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,We shouldn't be here! 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,What is it Eddie? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,There's something I didn't tell you guys. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know... "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Jesus. 82. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP," Why do you keep using our teams, guy? "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Wha? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"What does he mean by ""IT?"" "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"I know.   I've seen ""IT"" too. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"What exactly did you see here, Eddie? "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Guys, uh-- "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, It's here. 83. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I'm not going up there. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,The front door is right there. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP, The room seems to extend and last longer than anticipated. Finally they get to the door. Ben tries it. Nailed shut. 84. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Shit. Guys, look. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,There must be a window open. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Eddie, what are you doing? "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, Will runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to run down the stairs when... 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,What's happening?! 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Whatever it is, we don't want to go back in there. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,We have to do something. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Guys? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, Realizing he is alone. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Get me out of here. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,What do you mean you can't get down stairs? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,I- I think I broke my arm. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"I don't know, Richie. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,You gotta a better idea? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,No. No no no. Will?     Help me! 87. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,We can't leave him alone down there. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Hurry, guys! "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ, PENNYWISE Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I brought you some cracker-jack. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Go away! 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,No. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis BOWERS AND-- "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Well, that went well. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Guys, I hate to pile on bad news. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,No. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"That can't be true.   We just saw ""IT."" "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,This is all crazy.    Who are you guys anyway? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,The only losers in town- 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Welcome to the club, kid. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,The point of telling us was? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Just like my pa was trying to warn me the night I met you guys. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"That clown, whatever ""IT"" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"What do you mean, us, Will?    We're just kids. 95. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,We hurt it at Neibolt.   That's gotta mean something. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Everything dies. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from ""mom jail"" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to ""Tales from the crypt."" "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,It's only a matter of time one of us is found half eaten in the Barrens. Or worse. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,I need to study for my bar-mitzvah. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,He's just scared. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,No.   Feels fine I guess. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,I'm not allowed to see them. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,My Mom thinks they're the reason I got hurt. She says I'm sensitive and they don't take care of me like she does. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Yeah. Mom says I should always carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I ever have an episode. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Patrick was in one of the lockers. All the water bubbled up from there. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,What? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"My dad saw it near water, too.      The canal. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Unless you live way out in the sticks like I do. We have to tell the others. 104. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,I wasn't invited. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,My friend's party. I told ma-- 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,No one. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I know daddy. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"They're my friends, daddy. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I-- I swear. They're just friends. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just like you raised me. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,WHERE'D YOU-- 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"It's nothing, daddy.   Just a poem. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I told you I don't have one. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Daddy stop. You're hurting me. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't have to worry. I promise. Please! "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,What? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Daddy, please. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Not me, momma... You. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head. 108. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Then why did you send my friends away? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,This is what's going to happen now. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,No. No I'm not. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,What happened. Bowers? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,No.   My daddy. He... he... 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"I don't know. I don't know if it was him, or... "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,What? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"I think ""IT"" was there, controlling him, I don't know, I can't go back, I can't go back, Will. I don't know WHAT- "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,This storm is crazy.   Like the sky's gonna fall. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP," Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,How'd you escape? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Guess I'm not as weak as I thought. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,What do you mean your dad attacked you? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,It was like that lumberjack Ben told us about. The one from the Silver Dollar. He had this look. Like someone was pushing him to do it. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"You guys, if ""IT"" can take over Beverly's parents, why not the rest of ours? "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,I can't go back there guys. He'll kill me. Or worse. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"Will knows where to find ""IT."" "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,What do you mean? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Whoa whoa whoa. You don't really MEAN-- 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"If it means protecting Beverly, count me in. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Wait, count you in to what? "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,And friggin do what?   In this storm? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Hey guys.    How'd I do? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I hope your schlong grew those 12 inches cuz you're gonna need it. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,What do you mean? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Hold on. How are we-? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you didn't put this sucker on your gift list. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,How do you know? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Oh, fuck! "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Oh my God oh my God! 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Now what? 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Uh, guys? "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Dorsey's other shoe. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"Uh, guys! "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Pennywise? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Shit, ""IT"" has a name. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,"Here.   Will, over here. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Hurry! 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,No no no no no!   Guys! 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Oh my God oh my God oh my God. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,We don't want it to tear. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Take off your shoes. You'll be fine. Just move real real slow. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Hurry. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,OH NO- 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Something tells me we're not in Derry anymore. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,You think? 120. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Don't get too close to the edge, Will. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"It's up there isn't it?   That's where ""IT"" sleeps. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,You mean Pennywise. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Guess I'm going first again? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,You still afraid of a little grey water? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,You still wear diapers at night? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Mind equals blown right now. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,This is nothing like what it looked like from below. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real. 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,We do.   Or IT? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,"Not funny, Richie. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,What? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,The water. There's something in the water with us. 122. 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Guys. I don't think this is the best place to hang out right now. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,"Stanley, snap out of it. 123. "
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,Where am I? 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"Guys, the water thing.    IT's gone. "
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,What do you mean? 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Because we'll taste better. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,"And that's supposed to rally us, Will? "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Break into our homes, we break into yours. "
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,Charge! 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Will, it's a trick. "
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"It's trying to get to you, Will. Kill it. Kill it now. "
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Finish him, Will. For all of us. For Georgie. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I'm taking this fucker out. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Did we kill it? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,"You did it, Will. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,It's miller ti-- 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Shit! 
IT,STANLEYSTANURIS,ISTJ,We're going to drown down here aren't we? 
IT,BENHANSCOM,INFP,We're dead. So dead. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,"Guys, stop it. Focus. "
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,Now can we celebrate? 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,Will? 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,But we beat It.    We beat the cancer. 
IT,MIKEHANLON,ISFJ,Derry.   The clown.    It. 
IT,BEVERLYMARSH,ISFP,We all pitched in. 
IT,EDDIEKASPBRAK,ESTJ,Well Richie mostly. 
IT,RICHARDRICHIETOZIER,ENTP,I had to mow like five hundred lawns. Stan smoked the clippings.

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,She could be the third musketeer. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Where's your Mother? 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"I wake up every morning wishing I didn't know the answer to that question? If it wasn't for Ram and Allah, I would still have a Mother. "

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,I can't remember. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,I don't think it's Oxford.

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"Oh, I haven't. And it's not Leeds, because that's Elland Road, Kirkgate Market, Commercial Street, St Peter's- "
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"Well, I don't think it's Cambridge. "
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"Too obvious. There's definitely an Oxford Circus in London, and there's a rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge so there's probably a Cambridge Circus too. I'll go for D) London. "
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP, If the Gods are with me...Final answer. D.

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,You don't look so happy with a black eye. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Javed? You are with him? 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"Immediately, Sir. "
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Come away with me. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Love. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"It won't buy you a new dishwasher, but it might make you happy. "
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,You and me. That is the real world. Come away with me. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Salim will help us. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Where? 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Anything. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,I'll wait at VT station. Five o'clock every day until you come.

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Salim...!

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,"My brother's number, but- "
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,It's the only number I know. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Is that really you?

SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Latika? Latika? 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Truth alone triumphs? I should have known better. 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP,Latika? 
SLUMDOGMILLIONAIRE,JAMALMALIK,INFP," Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold each other's hands tight. The whole station seems frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being Jamal and Latika. "

ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,How come? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... These ain't my clothes. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... These ain't my pictures. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,You were ready to bite that guy's face. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Creed's great. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I said, how ya feelin'? "

ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Tomato? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,...What? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Come July, twenty-five. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yeah -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yeah, Kayo. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Spider Rice. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,You think everybody I fight is a bum. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,...No. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yeah, sure. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," ...I think I'm gonna take a steam -- Shoulda seen me fight -- Did good, y'know. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Wow -- cold!  Good night to catch pneumonia. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Ah -- I came in here for somethin'... Oh, yeah, would ya like somebody to walk ya home? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Hey, how's my buddy doin'? (looks into Butkus' cage) -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Catch pneumonia out there -- Seen Paulie? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, Paulie. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, Paulie. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Your sister's givin' me the shoulder. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Hey -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Don't get mental, man. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Ya always in a bad mood -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I'm thirty myself. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I don't see no crowd around you, neither. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Let's get outta this stink. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Sure. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Absolutely... 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Clown. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,He took his best shot an' became champ -- What shot did you ever take? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, CHIPPED TOOTH 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... No wine -- Bad for ya' brain. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,No wine. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Why? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,No dollar. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... That's an old one. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya brother know you're hangin' out so late? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, What'd you say? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Did these guys teach you to talk dirty?  Huh? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,What? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Don't you never say that -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Don't ya never come round this girl -- Go home. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face! 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,How come ya wanna hang out with those guys?  They teach ya bad things. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Hey!  When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Make your teeth yella -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Makes your breath like garbage. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty.  They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"(points down the block) ... That's your house, ain't it? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Listen, I hope ya don't -- "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,What was I gonna say? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Ya, somethin' like that. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"'Night, Marie. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," ... Yeah, who're you to give advice, Creepo. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder.  An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Ya sure? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,How'd you know? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Paulie's sister. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," She ain't retarded, she's shy. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Does that bum have to say that? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,He's always in a bad mood. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Don't like yours neither. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Move your shoulders down. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, GAZZO 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yeah. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Thanks, Mr. Gazzo. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, I usta be deadly at half-ball. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,What kinda business? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Maybe ya should see a doctor. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Maybe another job is the best thing. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Gazzo's gotta come to you. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Ya sister knows I'm comin'? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Maybe ya better forget it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"... Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's kinda hard for me to think of somethin' to say, y'know -- 'Cause I never talked to a door before, I mean whatta ya say to a door. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... Maybe I better forget it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't too happy at this moment, but would ya do me a favor -- I ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout you an' me goin' out -- Get somethin' to eat, maybe laugh a little, who knows... Would ya like, I dunno, go out together? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, We'll have a good time. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, What's ya sister like to do? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I didn't want no turkey anyway. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"To you, to me it's Thursday. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Looks quiet, y'know. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I think mebbe we're early or somethin' -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Listen, I gotta problem.  This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing -- "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise -- "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Ten minutes. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"... Yeah, give 'er the Blades. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles.  Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more.  All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight.  Kinda do it like a hobby.  See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Absolutely. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I just dislocated my finger. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,How 'bout some Cokes? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," See, I ain't graceful, y'know -- I don't move good -- Stink as a dancer too -- But I can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw an' nobody wants to fight a southpaw! -- Havin' a good time? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Y'know how I got started in the fight racket? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, What's funny? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.' "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Charge it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Had ya goin', didn't I, huh? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Some people are very shy by nature. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I would say you're very shy bu nature. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Then why did I bother bringin' it up?  'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"... I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket.  The roughest part is the mornin' after. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Guess. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Would ya like a glass of water? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," ... Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I had it pulled.  People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,D'you really wanna call? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,You sure? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Why? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I'll call your brother. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," !!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's with me!  I'll call ya later. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, What's the matter?  Ya don't like the room? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It's only temporary. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,What's the problem?  You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It's okay. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It's all right -- You're my guest. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, They're all the same. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, I'm not comfortable either. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Would ya take off your glasses? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,The glasses... Please. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Do me another favor? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Could ya take off that hat. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, I always knew you was pretty. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't have to kiss me back if ya don't feel like it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,'Bout what? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Message -- What message? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Ya puttin' me on? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,When was they here? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Balboa, Rocky Balboa. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Thanks. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Rocky. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,No -- Just me. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Sparrin'? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"... Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ.  He's just there to help condition the man. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Ah... Absolutely. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Feel?  I dunno... Happy. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I thought of it 'bout eight years ago, when I was eatin' dinner. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian! "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Sure I did.  You heard. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Why? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It don't matter. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It don't bother me none. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Help what? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I'll do okay. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,See ya tomorrow. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Ya puttin' me on, right? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,'Bout seven. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,It did. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I feel bad about walkin'. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,A few bucks. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Do I have to pay juice? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Gonna try. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,No action. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I'm gonna do somethin with it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Black market? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, you gonna show, Tony? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Look who's home! 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here?  Here, sit down. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yeah. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Freak luck for sure. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Freak luck is a strange thing. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Turtles -- domestic turtles. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Fifty years, huh. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,How 'bout a glass of water? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... What? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Ya got a good mind for dates. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Really think so? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Ya gave Dipper my locker. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,The fight's set -- I don't need a manager. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I got pain an' experience too. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Whatever I got, I always got on the slide.  This shot's no different.  I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... Tight. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... No. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Gazzo's a good man. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Keep this job, ya eat better. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Whatta you think? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,What? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Sure I like her. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I dunno -- she fills gaps. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,(shrugs and takes meat) She got gaps.  I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"That's why I can't put ya together with Gazzo, cause ya talk too much -- big mouth. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I never had good footwork. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Sure. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Should I do this? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... People talk to me more. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Apollo's a great fighter. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Maybe -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, I'll tear his head off. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Yo', Dipper, why're ya -- "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Sharp -- Real nice. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,No... Sharp -- You look great. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Can't fool around -- You look very great. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Ya right -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Whatta these guys want? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me in one day an' I hit the beef here an' liked it -- An' since I become a challenger, the owner don't mind neither. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I think me and Paulie invented it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yeah... Threw my whole day off. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... What's to say?  I dunno what he wants from me -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"... It's cold outside, Paulie. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Hey -- 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,What can I do about it? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"What break?  Huh?  What break! Who am I to give breaks!  I'm a fighter, you haul meat.  You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man! "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," ... An' what ya said to my girlfriend ain't right -- Do it again, I'll kill ya. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Wanna hear a dirty joke? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, Benny. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... I'll try. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, Any time. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... Run for mayor. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Yeah... 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," My first call... Hello?  Yeah, speakin' -- Who is this? Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo, Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't seen ya for nine or eight years -- Yeah, things is great, how's things with you upstate -- Ya sellin' real estate, hey, that's a good job... Yeah, I gotta advance, but I bought ringside seats for the guys at the gym.  I get the hundred an' fifty grand after the fight... "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," ... Yeah, I know it's a lotta money -- Condominiums?  Nobody uses them anybody.  Listen, I think a pet shop is a good investment, y'know -- I don't care 'bout long hours -- there's no depreciation -- that don't matter none to me -- Yeah, I like animals. Why don't ya give me ya number an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme getta pencil -- "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Okay, what is it -- four- twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah, thanks for callin' -- Sure I'll get back to ya, Bruce -- see ya. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... What? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I gotta go out for a while. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... Come. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... Can't do it. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... I can't beat him. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yeah, I can't beat him. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... I dunno. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before -- "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed.  If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood... "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, ... No foolin' around. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Yo, Mick, can I have my rob? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... I'm doin' it for a friend. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Whatta ya think that outfit cost? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP," Christ, Jack Dempsey. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,They must be friends. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try. "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,How am I doin'? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,See how fast he is -- damn! 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Damn!  How's it look? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,... The guy's great. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Fine... That guy's great. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP, See what? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,He ain't losin' nothin'. 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,Would you keep goin'? 
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes! "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"How I look out there, Mick? "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,"Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna make it -- I'm gonna make it! "
ROCKY,ROCKYBALBOA,ISFP,(impassioned and quietly) I'll kill ya all... Don't stop nothin' --

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP, Why'd you let him get to you? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Dorsey. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,(slightly sarcastic) I thought you were above all that 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,No. What do they say?

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Then why'd you ask? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Do what? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Start a band? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,So what did I have an effect on ?

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,If I go down. I'm takin' her with me

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Try lookin' at it from this angle 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Forget it.  I'm stayin'. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP, Maybe. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP, A soft side? Who knew? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,So what's your excuse?

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,People won't expect you to go... 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,So I have to have a motive to be with you? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP, Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.

THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,My grandmother's . 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,"That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story. "
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Wait I... 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,It wasn't like that. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,I didn't care about the money. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP, I cared about -- 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,I thought you could use it. When you start your band. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP," Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. "
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,"Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her. "
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP, You know -- it's not every day you find a girl who'll flash her tits to get you out of detention. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,I know 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Because I like to torture you. 
THINGSIHATEABOUTYOU,PATRICKVERONA,ISTP,Don ' t you even dare. . .

WALLE,WALLE,INFP, 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, Eve catches up to them. Flies over to Wall-E. Snatches her arm back. Just as she reattaches her gun...

WALLE,WALLE,INFP, Ee-vah...? 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, [Then I'm not going either.] 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, Carries his box back into the pod. Exits. Wall-E follows her right back out. Drives behind the console. You can't make me. Eve sighs. 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, The hallway elevator CHIMES. They both look up. Someone is coming. 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, Wall-E is inside the pod. Picks up the plant. Proudly shows it to Eve. 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, Ee-vah!

WALLE,WALLE,INFP, [You can't have it!] 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP," A warning alarm sounds. Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES. It slides into an AIRLOCK. Inner shield doors lock and seal. "

WALLE,WALLE,INFP, He groans. Not doing well. 
WALLE,WALLE,INFP, Eve gently opens his chest cavity. Examines the damage. Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD. Charred. Shorting out. Irreparable. She flies off into the depot. Searches for a new circuit board.

DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"And tell Richard I saw the pictures of for the feature on female paramedics and they're all so unattractive. I don't understand.

DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Where are the belts for this skirt? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Is something funny? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"This... stuff? Okay. I understand. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and select, say, that lumpy blue sweater because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what's on your body. What you don't know is that your sweater is not blue. It's not even sky blue. It's cerulean. You also don't know that in 2002, De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket, Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads, and in our September issue we did the definitive layout on the color. Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other major collections, then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on it. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Get me Isaac. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,These eggs are frigid. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Pick up the Polaroids from the swimwear shoot. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,The brakes in my car are making a weird noise. Take it in. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,We need the hat from the finale of the Zac Posen show. 32. The Devil Wears Prada   2nd Blue In Progress   12/00/05 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,The girls need new boogieboards for spring break. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Pick up my shoes from Manolo. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"...and while you're out, get Patricia. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Get me Isaac! 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,My flight is cancelled... Some absurd weather problem. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Please. It's just drizzling. Someone must be getting out. Call Donatella and get her jet. Call everyone with a jet -- Irv, Armani... "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Emily. Stop making excuses. GET ME HOME. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,The girls' recital was wonderful. They played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved it. Except for me... because I was not there. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Do you know why I hired you? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,That's all. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"The gowns are fabulous, Ralph. We're using the burgundy for the cover try and the lemon chiffon for the goddess story. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Sure, Doug! I'll get on it ASAP! A six- pack? No problem. Budweiser or Michelob? Chilled? Of course... "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Emily! 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Just let us out here. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Yes. I did. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Make sure you confirm my dinner with-- 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,And I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Fine. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,What did you want me to do? Walk out in the middle of a photo shoot? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,We were in a loft near the Seaport. My phone didn't work. I told you. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ, EMILY You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,An-dre-a. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,We have all the published Harry Potter books. The girls want to know what happens next. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,We know everyone in publishing. Shouldn't be a problem. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,My girls are leaving on the train to their Grandmother's at 3. They'll need the book by then. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,I'd like my steak in fifteen minutes. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,What is that doing here? I ordered it ages ago. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,One copy? What are my twins supposed to do with that... share? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,And where exactly are those fabulous copies? I don't see them anywhere. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Perfect. What about the accessories pages for April? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,We did that two years ago. What else? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Florals. For spring. Groundbreaking. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,No. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,No. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,I want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Only when the first assistant hasn't decided to be disgustingly ill. You'll come and help Emily. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,John. Good to see you. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Massimo, you made it. I was worried you'd be too busy with your new factory in Ortezzano-- "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ, Emily? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Ambassador, Rebecca. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Ah, Bonsoir, Cherie. Ta robe est rudement chouette. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Thank you for coming to our little get together tonight. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,And we're all so grateful. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Darling, there you are. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Come on, darling, let's get something to eat. I'm starved, aren't you? "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Andrea. Come up here. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Paris is the most important week of my year. I need the best team possible with me. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,That's all. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Don't forget to tell Emily. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ, There you are. We need to go over the seating chart for the luncheon. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Stephen won't be coming. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce, then ""fetch"" him. Fetch away. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Another divorce in the papers... and we all know what they'll say about me - - Dragon Lady, career-obsessed, drove away another ""Mr. Priestly"". "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Don't be ridiculous... why would you do that? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Your job. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ, Go. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Excuse me? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Excuse us a moment. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Do not disturb me again. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Are those freesias? 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"If I see freesia anywhere, I will be very disappointed. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Thank you everyone. Before I talk to you about James and everything he's accomplished, I have news. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,I'm ready to go. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,You thought I didn't know. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Then I let Irv know Jacqueline was unavailable. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Any of his other choices would find the job impossible and the magazine would surely suffer. Especially because of the list-- 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"...all of whom have promised to follow me whenever and if ever I leave Runway. To any publication I choose. Of course, as soon as Irv understood, he reconsidered. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"I must say, I was impressed with you, how intently you tried to warn me. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,Of course you can. You already did. To Emily. 
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"No. You did choose. You chose to get ahead. You want this life, those choices are necessary. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,"Don't be silly, Andrea. This is what everyone wants. Everyone wants to be us. "
DEVILWEARSPRADA,MIRANDAPRIESTLY,ENTJ,...I don't understand why it's so challenging to get a car when I ask for one. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"This is cancer, right? "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Slide. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Sure. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,And I saw you practicing this... 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Go ahead.  I'll expose you. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,A year?  How'd you manage that? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Why do you do it? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Really? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I don't know -- am I? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I'll take the parasites. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I want brain parasites. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I want that. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"So far, you have four and I only have two! "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," Yes, I'm selling some chothes. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh? "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Deal. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Looks like this is goodbye. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,How's this for not making a big thing? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Should we? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I suppose. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,It doesn't have your name.  Who are you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr. Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you give each night? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Where have you been the last few weeks? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You haven't been going to yours. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Really? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Like testicular cancer? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I can hardly believe anything about last night. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What... ? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Fuck you. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You got here fast. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Did I call you? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP, End of the hall. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,She's a monster!  Infectious human waste!  Good luck trying to save her! 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"If I fall asleep, I'm done for. You're gonna have to keep me up all night. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP, I want to have your abortion. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree -- so special, then, bam -- it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You can borrow it sometime. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Don't worry, I'm leaving. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," TYLER Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Please. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any? "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Good. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What happened to your hand? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Here. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Here. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Feel anything? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Make sure. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You feel nothing? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Well, that's a relief.  Thank you. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I wish I could return the favor. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I could check your prostate. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," Well... thanks, anyway. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Yeah, we're done.  See you around. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I'll be out of your way in a sec. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Whatever. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Chloe's dead. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Do you care? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,It was the smart move on her part. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What do you get out of it? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Hear what? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Nothing?  I don't think so. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What is this?  Who did this? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Guy or girl? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Why would you get bent if I asked? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You're afraid to say. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Can I come in? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Yeah? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What kind of stupid question is that?! 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Is this a trick? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love? "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Is that what you're calling it? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler? "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What is wrong with you? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What... ? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows, hugging the files to his chest, catching up. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," MARLA Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I don't want to hear anything you've got to say. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,I've done you enough favors. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Why is it free of charge? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie. "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You got about thirty seconds. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Whatever. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You are an insane person. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," MARLA No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Let go of me! 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again! 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Tyler... 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Why are you doing this? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP," I'm not paying this back.  I consider it ""asshole tax."" "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Tyler... 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You are the worst thing that ever happened to me. 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,You motherfuckers... 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,What happened... ? 
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,"My God, you're shot... "
FIGHTCLUB,MARLASINGER,ESFP,Who did this to you? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Turn that up please, dear. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I'll be God damned. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I was just wondering if you had found the ""Heart of the Ocean"" yet, Mr. Lovett. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh, yes. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I should like to see my drawing. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," It was a dreadful, heavy thing. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw it. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, The reflection has changed a bit. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," No, no. It's fine. I'm curious. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, No! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, It's been 84 years... 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was... 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You told me to change. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I felt like black. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time... "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!! "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Shit!! Come on, Fabri! "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Wait!! We're passengers! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Of course not. That's not the point. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Excuse me. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Don't do it. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Stay back! Don't come any closer! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Take my hand. I'll pull you back in. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, No you won't. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You're distracting me. Go away. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I'm a good swimmer. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, The fall alone would kill you. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, How cold? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Ever been to Wisconsin? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the-- "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I know what ice fishing is! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You're crazy. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Alright. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I'm Jack Dawson. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, HELP! HELP!! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I've got you. I won't let go. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Cal, stop! It was an accident. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Uh huh. That was pretty much it. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, My God... Cal. Is it a-- 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it... "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Hello Jack. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Hello again. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Could I speak to you in private? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Uh, yes. Of course. After you. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," So, you got a name by the way? "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Mr. Dawson, I-- "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Jack. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, here you are. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You're welcome. Rose. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," That penguin last night, is he one of them? "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Is he your boyfriend? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Worse I'm afraid. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Yes, exactly! "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, So don't marry him. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, If only it were that simple. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, It is that simple. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, I guess I will tonight. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, What's this? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Just some sketches. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, May I? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Well, well... "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You liked this woman. You used her several times. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, She had beautiful hands. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I see you. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, And...? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You wouldn'ta jumped. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I'm sorry. Really... I am. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, ...or a moving picture actress! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, A whole ten cents?! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Sure. If you like. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Your turn. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!... then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, That was great! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Shall we go dress, mother? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Not really. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, To making it count. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this little book. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, No thanks. I'm heading back. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Jack, must you go? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Want to go to a real party? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," May I cut in, miss? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," You're still my best girl, Cora. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I don't know the steps. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Just move with me. Don't think. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Wait... stop! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, How you two doin'? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You think a first class girl can't drink? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse? "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Oooowww! I haven't done that in years. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You're not one of them. There's been a mistake. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, A mistake? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, What would you wish for? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Something I can't have. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Rose!! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I was tired. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee-- 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, It's so unfair. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I was just here last night... don't you remember? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," I don't want money, I-- "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I just need to talk to Rose for a-- 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," It was them, not her. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and-- "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Jack, I-- "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," It's not up to you to save me, Jack. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You're right. Only you can do that. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh, look what I've done. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Hello, Jack. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I changed my mind. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Fabrizio said you might be up-- 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Sssshh. Come here. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Close your eyes. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Okay. Open them. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I'm flying! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Should I be expecting him anytime soon? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, What is it? A sapphire? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll. As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Tell me when it looks right to you. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to me. That's it. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Come on! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Take us down. Quickly, quickly! "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," After you, m'lady. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Where to, Miss? "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, To the stars. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Are you nervous? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Au contraire, mon cher. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Put your hands on me Jack. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You're trembling. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, It's okay. I'm alright. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I can feel your heart beating. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, This is crazy. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Looks okay. I don't see anything. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Could it have damaged the ship? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, We have to tell Mother and Cal. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Now it's worse. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Right. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Something serious has happened. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, This is horseshit. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you-- "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, But I was with him the whole time. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, They put it in my pocket! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I was going to return it! Rose-- 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know it! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You're certain? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Yes, I understand. Thankyou. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh, Mother shut up! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, You unimaginable bastard. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Goodbye, mother. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I'd rather be his whore than your wife. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Shit. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Bottom, left, right. I have it. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the rest of my life! Now take me down!! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Left, crew passage. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Right, right... right. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Jack? Jaaacckk?? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, ROSE!! In here! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I know, I know. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, So... how did you find out I didn't do it? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I didn't. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, There's no key in here. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You have to go for help. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, I'll wait here. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Hello? Somebody?! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Help me! We need help! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's-- 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," No, let me go! You're going the wrong way! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," See you there, buster! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Will this work? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, We'll find out. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Try a couple practice swings. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Now try to hit the same mark again. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Okay, that's enough practice. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Too deep. We gotta find another way out. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Fabrizio! Fabri! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Move aside! Quickly, move aside! "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, The boats are gone! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Colonel! Are there any boats left? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You better check out the other side. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I'm not going without you. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Get in the boat, Rose. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Go on. I'll get the next one. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, No. Not without you! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Almost as good as you. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, No Rose! NOOOO!! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot-- "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," You jump, I jump, right? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Right. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Let's go. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, We can't leave him. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Come on. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Back! Go back!! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, No! Not that way! Come back! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Help us! Please! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Come on! Come on! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as possible. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella? "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, We have to move! 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Come on! I've got you! 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, JACK 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I trust you. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Swim, Rose! SWIM! "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, It's so cold. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, What's that? 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, You'll die quicker if you come any closer. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Thank God for you Jack. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, It's getting quiet. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized... 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I love you Jack. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I'm so cold. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me? "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I can't feel my body. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful. "
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP," You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I promise. 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, Never let go. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," ""Come Josephine in my flying machine..."" "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, 
TITANIC,JACKDAWSON,ESFP, She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Oh, Jack. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I won't let go. I promise. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Is this in any way unclear? 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Dawson. Rose Dawson. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, Don't come any closer. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help. "
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP, I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs. 
TITANIC,ROSEDEWITTBUKATER,ISFP," You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I can't believe you can't get me out of this...I mean it's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday! It's not like I'm a defective or anything... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ, Last... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Mom, we're not supposed to study; we just have to sit there and do nothing. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ, Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Well...well.  Here we are!  I want to congradulate you for being on time... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Excuse me, sir?  I think there's been a mistake.  I know it's detention, but...um...I don't think I belong in here... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,It is now seven-oh-six.  You have exactly eight hours and fifty-four minutes to think about why you're here.  To ponder the error of your ways... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,...and you may not talk.  You will not move from these seats. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,...and you... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"...will not sleep.  Alright people, we're gonna try something a little different today.  We are going to write an essay--of no less than a thousand words--describing to me who you think you are. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Is this a test? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,And when I say essay...I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr. Bender? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Crystal... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself.  Maybe you'll even--decide whether or not you care to return. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"You know, I can answer that right now sir...That'd be ""No"", no for me. 'cause... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Sit down Johnson... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Thank you sir... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,My office... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,...is right across that hall.  Any monkey business is ill-advised... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,...any questions? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Yeah...I got a question. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"I'll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,That man...is a brownie hound... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You keep eating your hand and you're not gonna be hungry for lunch... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"I've seen you before, you know... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ, Who do I think I am?  Who are you? Who are you? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,I am a walrus... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"It's the shits, huh? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP," Bender starts loudly ""singing"" the musical part of a song.  �Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...� "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, I can't believe this is really happening to me... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do if we hafta take a piss? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Please... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,If you gotta go...

BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Really! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to get in here?  Forget to wash your jock? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ," Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we should just write our papers... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ," Look, just because you live in here doesn't give you the right to be a pain in the ass...so knock it off! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,It's a free country... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, He's just doing it to get a rise out of you!  Just ignore him... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if you tried! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,So...so!

BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ, Hey!  What's going on in there? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, ANDREW

BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Well, you know the door's s'posed to stay open... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,So what? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,So why don't you just shut up! There's four other people in here you know... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"God, you can count.  See!  I knew you had to be smart to be a...a wrestler. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Really... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"You know, Bender...you don't even count.  I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference.  You may as well not even exist at this school. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Well...I'll just run right out and join the wrestling team. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, BENDER 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"No, they wouldn't take you. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I'm hurt. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,You know why guys like you knock everything... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP," Oh, this should be stunning... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,It's 'cause you're afraid. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP," Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart, that's exactly why I'm not heavy in activities! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,You're a big coward! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ, I'm in the math club... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,See you're afraid that they won't take you.  You don't belong so you just have to dump all over it... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Well...it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes...now would it? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Well you wouldn't know...You don't even know any of us. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Well, I don't know any lepers either, but I'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs. "

BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, S'cuse me a sec... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Well, what I said was...I'm in the math club, the Latin club and the physics club...physics club. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the physics club? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,That's an academic club... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,So? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,So...academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Oh, but to dorks like him... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,...they are. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"In physics, um, we ah, we talk about physics...about properties of physics. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"So it's sorta social...demented and sad, but social.  Right? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation.  I mean there are other children in my club and uh, at the end of the year we have, um, you know, a big banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"You load up, you party... "

BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Only burners like you get high... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"And, uh, I didn't have any shoes. So I had to borrow my dad's.  It was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me to wear other people's shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana... He got high once and you know, he started eating like really weird foods.  And uh, and then he just felt like he didn't belong anywhere. You know, kinda like, you know ""Twilight Zone"" kinda. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here...I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, Oh and wouldn't that be a bite... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Missing a whole wrestling meet! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Well you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot!  You never competed in your whole life! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP," Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside because of it.  I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You don't have any goals. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Oh, but I do! "

BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"That's very funny, come on, fix it! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,You should really fix that! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Am I a genius? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"No, you're an asshole! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,What a funny guy! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Fix the door Bender! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Everyone just shhh! CUT TO: 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Why is that door closed? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Why is that door closed? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"How're we s'posed to know?  We're not s'posed to move, right? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Why? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"We were just sitting here, like we were s'posed to... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Who closed that door? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I think a screw fell out of it... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"It just closed, sir... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Who? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"She doesn't talk, sir... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ, Give me that screw... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I don't have it... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,You want me to yank you outta that seat and shake it out of you? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"I don't have it...screws fall out all of the time, the world's an imperfect place... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Give it to me, Bender... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ," Watch it, young lady... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"The door's way too heavy, sir. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ," Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on, front and center, let's go. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up? If he gets up, we'll all get up, it'll be anarchy! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Okay, now, watch the magazines! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,It's out of my hands... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"That's very clever sir, but what if there's a fire?  I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Alright, what are you doing with this?  Get this outta here for God's sake!  What's the matter with you? Come on! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,You know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, Show Dick some respect! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ, Let's go...go!  Get back into your seat. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ, I expected a little more from a varsity letterman! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, Eat my shorts... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,What was that? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, Eat my shorts! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"You just bought yourself another Saturday, mister! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Oh, Christ... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,You just bought one more right there! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Well, I'm free the Saturday after that...beyond that, I'm gonna have to check my calendar! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled, we'll keep goin'!  You want another one?  Say the word, just say the word!  Instead of going to prison, you'll come here!  Are you through. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,No! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,I'm doing society a favor! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,So? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"That's another one, right now!  I've got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don't watch your step!  You want another one? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Yes! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"You got it!  You got another one, right there!  That's another one pal! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Cut it out! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,You through? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Not even close, bud! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Good!  You got one more, right there! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Do you really think I give a shit? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Another... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,You through? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,How many is that? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,That's seven including the one when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ, Now it's eight... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Excuse me, sir, it's seven! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Shut up, Peewee! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,What can I say?  I'm thrilled! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,"Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you want these people to believe.  You know something, Bender?  You ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people.  You might be better off. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, Fuck you! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,RICHARDVERNON,ESTJ,Wake up!  Who has to go to the lavatory? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,That's real intelligent. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You're right...it's wrong to destroy literature... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"It's such fun to read...and, Molet really pumps my nads! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Mol-yare. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,I love his work. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Big deal...nothing to do when you're locked in a vacancy.. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Speak for yourself... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Do you think I'd speak for you?  I don't even know your language! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Hey, you grounded tonight? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"I don't know, my mom said I was but by dad told me to just blow her off. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Big party at Stubbies, parents are in Europe.  Should be pretty wild... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Yeah? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Yeah, can you go? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I doubt it... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,How come? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Well 'cause if I do what my mother tells me not to do, it's because because my father says it's okay. There's like this whole big monster deal, it's endless and it's a total drag.  It's like any minute... divorce... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Who do you like better? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,What? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You like your old man better than your mom? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,They're both strict. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"No, I mean, if you had to choose between them. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"I dunno, I'd probably go live with my brother.  I mean, I don't think either one of them gives a shit about me...it's like they use me just to get back at each other. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP, Ha!!! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Shut up! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,You're just feeling sorry for yourself... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else would. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Aw...you're breaking my heart... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Sporto... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,What? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You get along with your parents? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot, right? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You're an idiot anyway...But if you say you get along with your parents well you're a liar too! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"You know something, man...If we weren't in school right now, I'd waste you! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Can you hear this?  Want me to turn it up? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Hey fellas, I mean... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"...I don't like my parents either, I don't...I don't get along with them...their idea of parental compassion is just, you know, wacko! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Dork... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Yeah? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"You are a parent's wet dream, okay? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Well that's a problem! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kinda clothes.  But face it, you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie! What would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Why do you have to insult everybody? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"I'm being honest, asshole!  I would expect you...to know the difference! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Yeah well, he's gotta name! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Yeah? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Yeah, "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Brian... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,See... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, My condolences... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, What's your name? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,What's yours? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Claire... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Ka-Laire? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Claire...it's a family name! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Nooo...It's a fat girl's name! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Well thank you... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You're welcome... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I'm not fat! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Well not at present but I could see you really pushing maximum density! You see, I'm not sure if you know this...but there are two kinds of fat people.  There's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat...so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside!

BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Well, how'm I s'posed to answer? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"The idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit.  Like, uh, would you drive to school naked? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Um, uh...would I have to get out of the car? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Of course... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"In the spring, or winter? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,It doesn't matter...spring... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,In front of the school or in back of the school? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Either one... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Yes... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I'd do that! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"I'll do anything sexual, I don't need a million dollars to do it either... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,You're lying... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I already have...I've done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal...I'm a nymphomaniac! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Lie... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Are your parents aware of this? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,The only person I told was my shrink... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,And what'd he do when you told him? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,He nailed me... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Very nice... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I don't think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as rape since I paid him. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,He's an adult! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Yeah...he's married too! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Do you have any idea how completely gross that is? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"Well, the first few times... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,First few times?  You mean he did it more than once? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Sure... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Are you crazy? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Obviously she's crazy if she's screwing her shrink... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP, Have you ever done it? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I don't even have a psychiatrist... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Have you ever done it with a normal person? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Now, didn't we already cover this? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You never answered the question... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Look, I'm not gonna discuss my private life with total strangers. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"It's kind of a double-edged sword, isn't it? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,A what? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"Well, if you say you haven't... you're a prude.  If you say you have...you're a slut!  It's a trap. You want to but you can't but when you do you wish you didn't, right? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Wrong... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"Or, are you a tease? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,She's a tease... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Oh why don't you just forget it... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"You're a tease and you know it, all girls are teases! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I don't do anything! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,That's why you're a tease... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Okay, lemme ask you a few questions. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I've already told you everything! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love.  I mean don't you want any respect? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I don't screw to get respect...That's the difference between you and me... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Not the only difference, I hope. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Face it, you're a tease. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I'm not a tease! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Sure you are!  You said it yourself sex is a weapon, you use it to get respect! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"No, I never said that, she twisted my words around. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Oh then what do you use it for? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I don't use it period! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I didn't mean it that way!  You guys are putting words into my mouth! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Well if you'd just answer the question... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Why don't you just answer the question? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Be honest... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,No big deal... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Yeah, answer it! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Answer the question, Claire! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Talk to us! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"It's easy, it's only one question! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, No!  I never did it! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"I never did it either, I'm not a nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive liar... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,You are such a bitch!  You did that on purpose just to fuck me over! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I would do it though...If you love someone it's okay... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"I can't believe you, you're so weird.  You don't say anything all day and then when you open your mouth...you unload all these tremendous lies all over me! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,You're just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn't want to admit to... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"What's bizarre?  I mean we're all pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, How are you bizarre? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,He can't think for himself... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"She's right...do you guys know what, uh, what I did to get in here?  I taped Larry Lester's buns together. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ, That was you? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ," Yeah, you know him? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Yeah, I know him... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Well then you know how hairy he is, right?  Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Oh my God... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man...I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do.  And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee.  And Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me.  Yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And afterwards, when I was sittin' in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him.  And the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt.  It mustuv been unreal...I mean, "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"It's like me, you know, with my grades...like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know?  And I see me and I don't like what I see, I really don't. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,What's wrong with you?  Why don't you like yourself? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing shop.  See we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um...and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on...my light didn't go on, I got a F on it.  Never got a F in my life... When I signed up, you know, for the course I mean.  I thought I was playing it real smart, you know. 'Cause I thought, I'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Why'd you think it'd be easy? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I take shop...you must be a fuckin' idiot! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't make a lamp? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"No, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,What do you know about Trigonometry? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I could care less about Trigonometry... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Bender, did you know without Trigonometry there'd be no engineering? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Without lamps, there'd be no light! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Okay so neither one of you is any better than the other one... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"I can write with my toes!  I can also eat, brush my teeth... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,With your feet? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,...play Heart & Soul on the piano. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,I can make spaghetti! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, What can you do? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,I can...uh...tape all your buns together... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,I wanna see what Claire can do! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I can't do anything. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Now, everybody can do something... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"There's one thing I can do, no forget it, it's way too embarrassing. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean that guy's been doing that show for thirty years. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Okay, but you have to swear to God you won't laugh...I can't believe I'm actually doing this... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"All right, great!  Where'd you learn to do that? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Camp, seventh grade... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"That was great, Claire...my image of you is totally blown... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,You're a shit!  Don't do that to her you swore to God you wouldn't laugh! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Am I laughing? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,You fucking prick! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"What do you care what I think, anyway?  I don't even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference...I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"You know, I have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"God, you're so pathetic! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Shut up... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"Are those real diamonds, Claire? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Shut up! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Or did your daddy buy those? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Shut up! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"I bet he bought those for you!  I bet those are a Christmas gift! Right?  You know what I got for Christmas this year?  It was a banner fuckin' year at the old Bender family!  I got a carton of cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me and said ""Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"" Okay, so go home'n cry to your daddy, don't cry here, okay? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"My God, are we gonna be like our parents? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Not me...ever... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"It's unavoidable, it just happens. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,What happens? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"When you grow up, your heart dies. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Who cares? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I care... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I know it's kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering, um, what is gonna happen to us on Monday?  When we're all together again?  I mean I consider you guys my friends, I'm not wrong, am I? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,No... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"So, so on Monday...what happens? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Are we still friends, you mean? If we're friends now, that is? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Yeah... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Do you want the truth? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Yeah, I want the truth... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I don't think so... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"Well, do you mean all of us or just John? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,With all of you... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"That's a real nice attitude, Claire! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do?  I mean picture this, you're there with all the sports.  I know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,No way! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"'Kay, what if I came up to you? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Same exact thing! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, You are a bitch! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,No!  'Cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone!  And you don't got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell 'em that you're gonna like who you wanna like! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Okay, what about you, you hypocrite! Why don't you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high?  What about Andy for that matter, what about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together. They'd laugh their asses off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP," Don't you ever talk about my friends!  You don't know any of my friends, you don't look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things you know, shopping, nail polish, your father's BMW and your poor--rich--drunk mother in the Carribean! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Shut up! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"And as far as being concerned about what's gonna happen when you and I walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it!  'Cause it's never gonna happen!  Just bury your head in the sand...and wait for your fuckin' prom! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,I hate you! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Yeah?  Good! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Then I assume Allison and I are better people than you guys, huh? Us weirdos... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,I don't have any friends... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Well if you did? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,No...I don't think the kind of friends I'd have would mind... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"I just wanna tell, each of you, that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't and I will not!  'Cause I think that's real shitty... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"You're so conceited, Claire.  You're so conceited.  You're so, like, full of yourself, why are you like that? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, I'm not saying that to be conceited! I hate it!  I hate having to go along with everything my friends say! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Well then why do you do it? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"I don't know, I don't...you don't understand..you don't.  You're not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and I are friends with! You know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"I don't understand what?  You think I don't understand pressure, Claire? Well fuck you!  Fuck you! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Know why I'm here today?  Do you? I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a gun in the locker... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Why'd you have a gun in your locker? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on...and it didn't go on, I mean, I... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,What's the gun for Brian? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Just forget it... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"You brought it up, man! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"I can't have an F, I can't have it and I know my parents can't have it! Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I'm still only a B.  And everything's ruined for me! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Oh Brian... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"So I considered my options, you know? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,No!  Killing yourself is not an option! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I don't think so! "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,It was a hand gun? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"No, it was a flare gun, went off in my locker. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Really? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,It's not funny... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was destroyed! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,You wanna know what I did to get in here?  Nothing...I didn't have anything better to do. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,You're laughing at me... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,No! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Yeah you are! CUT TO: 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Brian? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Yeah? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Are you gonna write your paper? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Yeah, why? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"Well, it's kinda a waste for all of us to write our paper, don't you think? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us to do... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"True, but I think we'd all kinda say the same thing. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,You just don't want to write your paper...Right? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"True, but, you're the smartest, right? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ," Oh, well... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,We trust you... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,Yeah... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,"All right, I'll do it... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Great... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ, Come on... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Where're we going? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Come on! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Don't be afraid. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Don't stick that in my eye! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,"I'm not sticking it, just close... just go like that... "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Good... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,You know you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Hey...I like that black shit... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,This looks a lot better...look up. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,"Please, why're you being so nice to me? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,'Cause you're letting me. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,You lost? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Cool! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP, Thank you! CUT TO: 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Why'd you do that? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,'Cause I knew you wouldn't. 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,"You know how you said before, how your parents used you to get back at each other...wouldn't I be outstanding in that capacity? "
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,Truth? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,CLAIRESTANDISH,ESFJ,Truth... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP,No... CUT TO: 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,What happened to you? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Why?  Claire did it!  What's wrong? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ,"Nothing's wrong, it's just so different.  I can see your face. "
BREAKFASTCLUB,ALLISONREYNOLDS,ISFP,Is that good or bad? 
BREAKFASTCLUB,ANDREWCLARK,ISFJ, It's good! 
BREAKFASTCLUB,BRIANJOHNSON,ISFJ,Hey Carl... 
BREAKFASTCLUB,JOHNBENDER,ESTP, See you next Saturday... 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, C'mon �-- you have to help me pick out the perfect outfit. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Too demure? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming. . . "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, He's proposing! I can't look like I would on any date. This is the date. The night I'll always remember. I want to look special. Bridal . . . but not like I suspect anything. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Wh at if -- you know -- it's not the night? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Is this a low-viscosity rayon? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, With half-loop top-stitching on the hem? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," It's impossible to use a half-loop topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get this in, because I remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, So are you! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I am so ready. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Here' s to ~ us. Warner is slower to sip his. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I ' m fully amenable to that discussion. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Of course. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, And I fully support that. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I completely agree. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," What? Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You're breaking up with me?! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Then what? My boobs are too big? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," So when you said you'd always love me, you were just ""dicking around""? Warner looks around the restaurant nervously. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, No. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, How can it be the right thing if we're not together? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Just because I ' m not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I ' m white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderb ilt -- "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I ' m seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough? He looks away. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, SERENA 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, No -- it's just -- not me. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone mo r e -- 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I just don ' t underst a n d what went wrong -- 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Last month on his birthday. And she liked me! She said I looked like Britney Spears. Why would you say that to someone you didn't like? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I don't know! I don't know anything any more! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ,ANOTHER SISTER passes. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I just love him so much! I loved him the first moment I saw him. He's beautiful and smart and someone I totally respect. And I did everything I could to make him love me, but it wasn't enough. Now what am I supposed to do? I planned my whole future around him. My life was going to be all about Warner. Now what's it going to be about? She looks up -- waiting. Staring back at her is Underdog -- who sadly has no answers for her. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, So? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Oh, my God!                    . She looks at a PHOTO of a horse-faced YOUNG WOMAN standing next to a THREE-YEARS-OLDER VERSION OF WARNER. She turns to the old lady next to her. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, It's Warner's older brother! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, He just got engaged to this -- this very unfortunate-looking girl. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, No -- a law student. Elle rushes out.   Serena looks after her. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ,(turning back to her nail technician) She'll never get him back with those cuticles. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, That's right. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I don't need backups.      Harvard is the school I' m going to. He decides to humor her. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Reading about the LSATs. Margot looks at Serena, confused. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, The LSATs are an exam. She takes a deep breath. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, No -- I ' m going to law school at Harvard. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan! "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma! Margot pulls something off her wrist and hands it to Elle. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Your scrunchie? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been              . brainwashed by the evil Stefano -- "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I feel confident using legal jargon in daily life. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Dylan!   We love you! Dylan McDermott burns rubber as he flees. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ,"                                            . . I'm totally focused and goal-oriented. Plus I ' m able to sway people with my very convincing arguments.                                       . She turns to Serena, jogging next to her. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, One seventy-five...one seventy- five... 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, It's a perfectly respectable place... 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Because this is what I want. I've worked hard for it. Don't you understand that this is important to me? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," We're here! She bends down to pour some Evian into his inflatable doggy dish, inadvertently revealing cleavage to a passing BESPECTACLED BOY . He trips, dropping his I-MAC. It shatters into a million pieces. Not noticing/ Elle stands and turns to two MOVING GUYS/ who are hauling a pink, faux-fur love seat and a potted palm tree out of the truck. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, H a s Warner Huntington checked in yet? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, W a i t -- my social events schedule is             . mis sin g. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," You know -- mixers, formals, beach �         trips. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree from USC, where I was Sigma Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma, and last year '� -- I was Homecoming Queen . "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first class as a serious law student. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Elle turns, ultra-nonchalant. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Warner?! Oh my God, I completely forgot you were going here! "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," No, silly.    I go here. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Harvard. Law school. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thanks. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Uh... I wasn't aware that we had an assignment. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out? He smiles. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Donovan, Royalton and Levinson. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Wow.   I ' m glad I met you. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Are you a third-year? Warner walks up, behind Emmett, interrupting. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Hi! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Do anything exciting? A female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind. Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side, presenting her. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Excuse me. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You can't even imagine. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I worked really hard to get into law school -- I blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, I completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video -- all so I could get my boyfriend Warner back and now he's engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing! I wish I ' d never even come to Harvard. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six-carat on her bony, unpolished finger. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, No! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, That's terrible! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate- looking. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Definitely! I love him! Paulette looks at her. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Warner? When she gets no answer, she write a message on his memo board -- CLOSE ON-- ""Call me! Love, You Know Who"". She leaves the wine bottle and two glasses and goes. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Neither. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I'd rather have a client who's innocent. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I changed my mind. I ' d pick the dangerous one. She looks pointedly at Sarah. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," '        I ' m here to join your study group. And look! I brought sustenance! She holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all around. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Who's first? She sits down next to Warner. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Then I guess I'll leave you alone. She walks away, completely deflated, passing by the RAGING FEMINIST STUDY GROUP. Enid calls out. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I don't use that word. Only mean people use that word. You must've heard it from Sarah.                     . She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does., she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands there, even more depressed. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Power yoga? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, � What?! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Almost. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, What? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Iwl. il.   .    . Margot hangs up and Elle follows suit.      Even more deflated. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I can't believe this. Not only do I not have Warner, but I ' m --unpopular! The realization hits her hard. Underdog barks.       She looks at him. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Enid, please -- silicone is so 90's. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I am. Didn't you hear about the Playboy Bunny who slit her ex- boyfriend's new fiancee's throat with a broken wine glass? It was tragic. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Hey, O.J. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thank you.     Having fun? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," But what? We took the same LSAT, we take th e same classes -- "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I'11 never be good enough for you, will "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You know what? All of you can just kiss my ass. She yanks off her Bunny tail and throws it at them. Hurt and anger in her eyes. Then walks out of the room. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Don't ask. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, To negate mens rea? Donovan nods affirmatively and continues.      Elle hides a smile. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Don't you also need to have evidence? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Meaning you need -- reasonable belief that your claim would have, like, evidentiary support? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one-night- stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions -- then he has no parental claim whatsoever over this child. Why this s p e rm ? Why now?      ' "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I did? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I don ' t know -- 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? . "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard- ass. Elle stops the car and turns off the ignition. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Yes, you are.       Go -- you can do this.                  . She points ahead of them.        Paulette goes. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Dewey Newcomb? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, . I ' m Elle Woods. Ms. Bonaf ante's                  �        . attorney. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, W e did it!                                                 . Elle high-fives her. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Look at him. He's still scratching his head. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Madonna? The class rolls their eyes and laughs, watching Stromwell. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, What's going on? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, He chose them already? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thank you. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Wait a minute -- are we talking about Brooke Daniels? Donovan checks his papers. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated ,five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing! The others looks at each other and roll their eyes. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Maybe she found him like that. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," There's no    way Brooke could've done this - - exercise    gives you endorphins, endorphins    make you happy -- happy people don't kill    their husbands! Sarah and Enid snort. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Of course, I do! "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I ' m a Delta Gamma and I ' m a huge fan of yours! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Sort of. Brooke looks at Elle as if she's her savior. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I ' m the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, It's who? She turns to look as we go to -- 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Trust'me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual. Elle stands.                                                 , "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Good. Now this time, put a little arch in your back and maybe get your footing more solid. Paulette does it again. This time, getting it right. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Good. She adjusts her like a yoga instructor would. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," More snap, less bend. She turns to the rest of the clients. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," There is no way a Delta Gamma would sleep with a man in a shiny shirt. Warner, back me up here. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," So, because she's beautiful and has a good body, she's easy? What book of feminist theory did you read iiiai in, Enid? Emmett jumps in before war breaks out. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Al l I know is-- it's not Brooke. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I ' m here to see Brooke Wi'ndham. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Uh -- family. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I ' m her sister. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Delta.   Gamma. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Are you okay? You look so sad...and so .               orange. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," He means well.      He's really brilliant and all. Brooke sits, not looking convinced. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I brought you some necessities. Pink sheets. Aromatherapy candles. Loofah. And The Bible. She holds up a ""Cosmopolitan"". "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," But I have to tell you the real reason I ' m here. Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Who could better understand than me? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Whatever it is -- it could save you. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, How? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I know!   You helped me go from a six to a four! Brooke starts to cry again. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, No! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Your secret is safe with me. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I went to get her alibi. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, But I can't tell you what it is. Yes. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I promised her I ' d keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I can't give it to you. All I can tell you is that she's innocent. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," , No! "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Then we're not very good lawyers. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I gave her my word, Warner. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I can go if you want. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Aside from that. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Why? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, But maybe it's not what you think. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You're kind of being a butt-head right now. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised. They're quiet again while he thinks about this.         He looks over at her. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Maybe not to your face... 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, We have two o'clock massages. Kerrigan and Woods. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark is here somewhere and I ' m supposed to meet her. for a Pilates class. Do you have her schedule? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," No, she can't move for an hour. She grabs his arm and pulls him down the hall. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Mrs. Windham Vandermark? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Did you see the icky black color of her hair? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I ' m starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund. He looks at her and laughs. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, ""Oh, the poor widow."" "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," You should see the way I ' m treated in class! I'm a complete source of mockery. This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund is needed. He goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it. Emmett frowns. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take? �. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Speaking of that �-- I bought you some seaweed cream while we were at the spa. She hands it to him.    He keeps his hands on the wheel, not taking it. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Well, you should --. I f you look good,     you            � feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, .          Fine. Sorry I brought it up. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, For a butt-head? Yes. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, F or what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I believe you! Don't worry. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Come in. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Take it. I've read it twenty times. She grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading. Sarah lingers. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Too bad you and I are the only ones. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, It's not my alibi to tell -- 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Men are helpless.     You know that. Sarah lingers, leaning on the edge of the couch. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I know.     He has it sent out. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Oh, my God!                       ' -. Sarah watches as Elle jumps up to hug the girls, who each have a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in their hands. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Margot! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I'll call you as soon as it's over, okay? Sisters forever? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, He's gay!    Enrique is gay! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, See? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Gay men know designers.     Straight men don't. She points at Warner, who shrugs. Brooke leans over. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Enrique's gay. I ' m sure of it.' 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thanks for the backup. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thank you! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Great. Donovan actually said the words ""Good work, Ms. Woods"". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Is everything okay? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I ' m sorry, but -- "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Wow. That means so much to me to hear you say that. Donovan walks around his desk and sits in the chair opposite her. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, So everything you just said --? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, And I ' m a law student who's finally realized her professor is a pathetic asshole. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, What? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I'm quitting. She marches past.   He follows, catching up. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Law school was a mistake.   Getting this internship was a mistake. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I didn't earn anything. I got this internship because Donovan liked the way I looked. Which he made clear .tonight when he tried to feel me up. Emmett looks pissed as he processes this. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty-hose. No more trying to be something I ' m not. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thanks for not treating me the way everyone else here does. Call me if you're ever in California. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding mys elf -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ,                              - See? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Yes, I am. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Elle Woods, your honor. Rule 3:03 of the Supreme Judicial Court states that a law                     � student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a defense witness. The crowd murmurs.     Donovan rolls his eyes. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," First, your Honor, I ' d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there's a complete lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will. The DA rolls her eyes, as do the lawyers present. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," And when you came downstairs, what happened? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Did you hear a shot fired? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," So at some point in the -- twenty minutes? -- you were in the shower, your father was shot? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Your father was shot while you were in the shower? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Where you got in the shower. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a                .       . perm before, Miss Windham? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," How many, would you say? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to ~ curls really weren't the right look for her -- "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," And wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father? "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, I can't believe you're a Laker Girl! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Thank you. He moves closer. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Really? He turns on the charm. 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," I want to be with you, too, Warner. After a moment, she steps back, removing his hand       from her             ' waist and wrenching it behind his back. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Huh.     Imagine that.   Looks like I am. She walks down the steps. Warner watches her go,        then turns to see Sarah, who's witnessed the entire episode.        She glares at him, then walks past. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Yes, you are. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Yes, he is. �                                    . They look at each other in a silent truce. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, You're pawning The Rock?! 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Are you asking me on a date? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ," Perfect. She heads down the stairs, stops and thinks a moment, then runs back up -- -- Grabbing Emmett in a hellacious KISS. He kisses her back. We CRANE UP as they embrace on the courthouse steps. "
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Is he the only one? 
LEGALLYBLONDE,ELLEWOODS,ENFJ, Only blonde at heart. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP, 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm just excited to get back. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Look how pink. So pretty. 2A. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,What? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I think it's sad. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Beth's such an amazing dancer. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Fonteyn danced into her 50's... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,If you want me to be. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I'm good. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Should I go again? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It went okay. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Ow! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm fine! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,If that girl hadn't barged in. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"I know, mom. 15A. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Do you have a minute? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,If now's not a good time... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Well... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Yes, but- "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, I see. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, I came to ask you to give me the part. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I can be the Black Swan too. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I want to be perfect. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I- 18A. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, NINA 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Veronica? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, What? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," Stunned, she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Hey...Everything's fine...He picked me, mommy. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Mom? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Oh, mom. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Just a little piece. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,My stomach's still in knots. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," Mom, don't. I'm sorry. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It looks yummy. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Yeah...good luck finding a spot. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I know you are. I'm Nina. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Okay. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Thanks, Susie. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Beautiful. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Such a beautiful event. 29. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Just a second. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Nina. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Our New Swan Queen! That is so huge! You must be freaking out. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Yeah... 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Stay. Keep me company. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Excuse me. 31. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I think I drank too much. All those toasts... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Really? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, I guess. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Oh, Upper West Side. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"No, that's good. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Hello? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Some of us don't need to do that. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," Beth, I'm- "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Thanks. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Yes. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Me neither. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,No... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,A few. But no one serious. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Excuse me? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Okay. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Yes? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You know I asked. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,That's not why. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,They're fake. 37. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I can do it. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's just a rash. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,NO- 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Mom, please. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,What happened? 40. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Oh my god... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,How do you know? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Was it right after we saw her? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's okay. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Please don't... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Who's that? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,You okay? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm fine. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,You sure? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,We can't smoke in here. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I won't tell if you won't. 48. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Thanks... 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"So, want to talk about it? "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Just had a hard day. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Leroy play too rough? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,He's brilliant. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Sure, but not exactly warm and fuzzy. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You don't know him. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Someone's hot for teacher. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I should go. It's getting late. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Hey, I was only playing. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, She ignores Lily and exits. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," Nina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'll be out in a second. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Do you have any corrections? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I didn't tell her that. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,THOMAS- 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,She shouldn't have said anything! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I didn't. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Lily, I need to talk to you. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Okay... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Now. 53. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Shut up. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,What's wrong? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You told Thomas about last night? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I ran into him this morning. He said you guys were having some trouble. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Why would he talk to you? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Whoa your highness, I just told him you're working your ass off and I'm sure you'll be great. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You shouldn't have done that. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I didn't fucking do anything. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,He's not. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Thanks. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,What career? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You were 28. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,And only... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Nothing. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Nothing. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's fine. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Yes. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,No. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Who was it? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Hello? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Hey. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, What are you doing here? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I wanted to apologize. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Give me a second. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Mom, please! "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,She's a trip... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,How did you know where I live? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I have my ways. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I don't think- 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,A drink? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Jesus. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Wait. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm going out. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Let's go. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Can't believe that's what he called her. So gross! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I think it's sweet. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Little princess? He probably calls every girl that. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Only Beth. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Well, I'm sure she lost the title after her game of chicken. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I don't think so. 59. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Sure, just gotta let him eat the pussy. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Danke schoen. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Oh, I will. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,What? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Guess I'm invisible. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Here, wanna spruce up? "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I wouldn't know. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Yeah, right. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I don't want to talk about it. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Relax, you're so tense. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,What is it? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,You're kidding? You never rolled? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, How long does it last? 61. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Couple hours. Tops. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,That's okay. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Sure? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Heeey, thought we could use some drinks. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm gonna go. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,This is Tom and this is Jerry. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Hi. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"You can't leave, I bought you a drink. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"I really shouldn't, we're on the stage tomorrow. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"What, you gonna go home to mommy? Live a little. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Just a couple of hours? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Tops. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Oh, I'm a dancer. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Nina. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,We're blood sisters. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,We dance in the same company. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Tom and Jerry are gay lovers. 64. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Oh, I just assumed. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,In that case you're definitely NOT gay. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," No, it's not. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP, It's not for everyone. You probably aren't sophisticated enough. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Isn't that compliment a little premature? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,I think we all need another round. Bottom's up. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Sorry. Swan Lake. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You know it? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"It's beautiful, actually. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Huh? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,My hands are all sweaty. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," Nina turns towards the voice and, with relief, sees Lily exit the club. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP," Lily smiles back, and then ""walks"" her hand up the leg, until it reaches the edge of Nina's dress. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Mmm-hmm. Late. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,To the moon and back. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Ding ding ding. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Huh? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You want to know their names? 69. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,There were two. Tom and Jerry... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, I fucked both of them. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Don't come in here! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,LEAVE ME ALONE!!! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Why didn't you wake me up? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, My music. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Thomas, I'm sor- "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Hey... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, I overslept. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Oops... Least you had a good time, right? "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You put something in my drink. 74-76. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP, Yeah... 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,And took off this morning. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,This morning? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"Yeah, you slept over. "
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and you have a dick. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,But we... 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"We what, Nina? "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You're lying. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP," Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Stop. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Was I good? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Shut up! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, What's she doing here? 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,He made me your alternate. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Thomas! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Lily. You made her my alternate. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,She wants my role. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, NINA Please believe me. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,THOMAS- 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,What happened? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Hey! Hey! I'm still in here. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm so sorry. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I just wanted to be like you. Perfect. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's not true. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Beth?! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Stop it! Stop! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Mommy?! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,GO AWAY! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Get OUT! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Where's the clock? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It's dark. What night is it? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,"No, I want to. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Get off me! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Where is it? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Move. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, Nina grabs her by the wrist. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,You're crazy! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,She's gone. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Let go! 87A. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,What are you doing here? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, She turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind her. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,You're supposed to be sick. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I'm fine. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ," She doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and sets it on her chair. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ, NINA What? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Fuck. Have you announced it? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,"Rough start, huh? Pretty humiliating... 95. "
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Get out of here. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Wow...rude. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Stop. Just stop. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,How about...I dance the Black Swan for you? 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Leave me alone. Leave me alone. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Leave me alone!!! 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,One second. 
BLACKSWAN,LILYBLACKSWAN,ESTP,Hey...you were amazing. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,I felt it. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,...perfect. 
BLACKSWAN,NINASAYERSSWANQUEEN,INFJ,Shhh... 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What so you want to know? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause � get a load of this � if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Royale with Cheese. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Mayonnaise. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,How many up there? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Counting our guy? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,So there could be five guys up there? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,We should have fuckin' shotguns. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What's her name? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,How did Marsellus and her meet? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,She ever do anything I woulda saw? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What's a pilot? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I don't watch TV. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Yeah. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah maybe, fat right? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I think I know who you mean, what about him? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"What'd he do, fuck her? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Well what then? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,A foot massage? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,That's all? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What did Marsellus do? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,That's a damn shame. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out � no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Not the same thing, the same ballpark. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Have you ever given a foot massage? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Given a lot of 'em? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Have you ever given a guy a foot massage? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,How many? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Would you give me a foot massage � I'm kinda tired. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, Seven-twenty-two in the morning. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What's her name again? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,It's not a date. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,No. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I ain't hungry. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Royale with Cheese. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Got it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, Vincent looks up at Jules. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,We're happy. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Where's the big man? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,At Marsellus' request. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Not yet. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What's so funny? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I ain't your friend, palooka. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I think ya heard me just fine, punchy. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP," Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,That's a bold statement. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Give me three hundred worth of the madman.  If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You don't mind if I shoot up here? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Mucho gracias. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You know what some fucker did to it the other day? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Fuckin' keyed it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days � five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Hello? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM � NIGHT 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Hello. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, Hello. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, Okay. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What the fuck is this place? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"After you, kitty-cat. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Did you just order a five-dollar shake? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,A shake? Milk and ice cream? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,It costs five dollars? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You don't put bourbon in it or anything? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Just checking. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Rollin' a smoke. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,It's just tobacco. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"You can have this one, cowgirl. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Think nothing of it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Sure did. I heard you did a pilot. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What was it? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What was your specialty? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Do you remember any of the jokes? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Tell me. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"C'mon, don't be that way. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,That's not what I meant and you know it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I meant I wouldn't laugh at you. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What a gyp. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah, but maybe I do. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I don't know. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I'll do that. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,No there's not. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,That's Marilyn Monroe... 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I have moments. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Only if you promise not to get offended. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Then let's just forget it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Is that a fact? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What do you think about what happened to Antwan? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Tony Rocky Horror. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"No it's not, it's just what I heard. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,They. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,They certainly do. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"No and, that's it. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Yeah. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,But did it happen? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"No, no, no no, no, no, no, no. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, All right. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"All right, you asked for it. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Was than an uncomfortable silence? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I'm gonna take a piss. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"...It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say ""Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening,"" go home, and jack off.  And that's all you're gonna do. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Jesus Christ! 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, Mia! MIA! What the hell happened? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP," Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You still got an adrenaline shot? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin'  Doing on me. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,No choice. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Yeah. She's dyin'. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Negative. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Sorry. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Too late, I'm already here. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now! "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,She's ODing on us. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, You two are a match made in heaven. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What do you need a medical book for? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You've had that thing for six years and you never used it? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Well then get it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot! 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Does it have to be exact? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I need a big fat magic marker, got one? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You're gonna give her the shot. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I've never does this before. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Okay, what do I do? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I gotta stab her? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What happens after that? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,This ain't a fuckin' joke man! 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Count to three. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What are your thoughts on how to handle this? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I seriously doubt that. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Let's shake on it. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Mum's the word. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I can't wait. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Mia. How you doin'? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind?  Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,.357. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah, we were lucky. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah, maybe. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I think we should be going now. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"...Ever seen that show ""COPS?""  I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What the fuck does that mean? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Jesus Christ! 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Goddammit, Jules � "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,� you're fuckin' freakin' out! 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Marvin, what do you make of all this? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"� chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how! "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"� I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Can't we just take it to a friendly place? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Who ya callin'? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Where's Toluca Lake. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"If he kicks us out, whadda we do? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I was just dryin' my hands. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You watched me wash 'em. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP," A ""please"" would be nice. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I said a ""please"" would be nice. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,All the way? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Are you sure this is absolutely necessary? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Redondo Beach. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,You know I could go for some breakfast.  Want to have breakfast with me? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Thanks a bunch. (to Jules, who's nursing his coffee) Want a sausage? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Are you Jewish? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Why not? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP, About what? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,An act of God. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,But why? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"So you're serious, you're really gonna quit? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"What do you mean, walk the earth? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,How long do you intend to walk the earth? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,What if he never does? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,So you decided to be a bum? 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be � a fuckin' bum! "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,� what happened was peculiar � no doubt about it � but it wasn't water into wine. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Stop fuckin' talkin' like that! 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I gotta take a shit. To be continued. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP," What the hell's goin' on, Jules? "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,Check. 
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,"Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle. "
PULPFICTION,VINCENTVEGA,ISTP,I think we oughta leave now.

SOUTHPARK,STANMARSH,ISFP,"Are you sure, Kenny? "
SOUTHPARK,STANMARSH,ISFP,He said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back.

SOUTHPARK,KYLEBROFLOVSKI,INFJ,"Whew, I'm sure glad that's over. "
SOUTHPARK,STANMARSH,ISFP,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other. "

CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, What are those? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, I wish I had some. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, No I won't. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," No, I won't. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door. She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,...dirtypillows. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Clearly torn � tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror � as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I can't! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Yes, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," I always do, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It's... beautiful. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Oh uh? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,M... M... Miss Collins... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I'm bleeding. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,16 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It hurts... my stomach... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I can't. I don't know how! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Carrie. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, That's not my name! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, 43. LONGER CUT 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Concentrating her hatred 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, She walks across the street. 21 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," She keeps on walking, ignoring him. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Turning toward him, her face contorted with rage. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, She is staring across the street at: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," The boy's defiant chant can be heard as Carrie blinks, wondering. Then she opens her eyes, wider. She looks at the boy. She frowns for a moment. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," A faint smile, partly of wonder, partly of a strange kind of joy. She knows. 23 "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street. She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe � her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Hello, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Who was it that called? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared... "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Why didn't you tell me? Oh, Momma � "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"I was so scared! And the other girls, they made fun of me and threw things and � "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, please help me. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,They threw things... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, please listen. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,You should have told me! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"No, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, let me go. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," She looks away � and inwards. With her, we see: "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Please! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," She is standing in the entrance of the living room. Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm, almost too calm. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the  head. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Good night, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Another beat; then: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,41 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, CARRIE Ohuh? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Okay. 58 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, It's about... um.. sewing... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,What? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I don't like to be tricked. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,59 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Which he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird moment, this contact. She turns around, her head painfully ducked down. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Carrie, what's the matter? "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Miss Collins... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,When can I come back to gym? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I got asked to the prom. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Tommy Ross asked me. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I know who he goes around with. They're trying to trick me again. I know. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It would be a nightmare. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,What... what're you doing here? 66 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma's resting. What do you want? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I already told you. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Why are you doing this? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I can't. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,You better go. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"No one, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I can't. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,They'll laugh. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Please. Please go. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Why? Why is it so important to you? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Yes. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Fine. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Watching him. She takes the hand he ""touched"" and brushes the hair back from her face. A little beautiful? You bet. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Coming, Momma. Coming. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"It makes me have pimples, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, please see that I have to start to get... to try and get along with people. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I... I've been invited to the prom. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"It's next Friday, and � 71 "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, please see that I'm not like you. I'm funny, I mean, the kids think I'm funny. I don't want to be. I want to try and be a whole person before it's too late to � "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," His name is Tommy Ross, and he's a very nice boy. He's � "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"-- promised to stop in and meet you before, and � "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,-- have me in by midnight. I've � 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,-- accepted. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," I've accepted, Momma. I have accepted. 72 "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Everyone isn't bad, Momma, everything isn't sinful. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"You'll like this boy, he.... "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma � 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Please stop... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, you better stop. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"I've already said I would, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, sit down. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I'll get them. Please sit and talk to me. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"I'm going, Momma. And things are going to change around here. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows that. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"He ran away with a woman, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"I don't care. He asked me to go. And I'm going. I'm going, Momma. You can't stop me. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Only clearing the thread, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Oh, momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, it doesn't have anything to do with Satan. It's me. If I concentrate hard enough, I can make things move. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, there are other people... people with the power... It's a part of me. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"If it were, I'd know it. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, I'd know. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"I'm going to do my homework, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Come in, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Do you want to pin it on, Momma? "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Breasts, Momma, breasts. Every woman has them. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 84 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"No, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Stop it, Momma. I'm nervous enough. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Stop hurting yourself, Momma. That's not going to stop me either. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Go away, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. It'll be okay. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 85 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, sit on the bed. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"You'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that I'm not like you, not anymore. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret: "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"I'll be home early, Momma. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, you will be quiet until I'm gone. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It's like a dream. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Easier said than done. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. Please � not yet. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Yes. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Tommy... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, I made it. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No shit. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Yes. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," That's a lovely dress, Carrie. Wherever did you get it? "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I made it. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I'm Don MacLean's secret lover. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,They're nice. George is funny. 92 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Could we just sit here for a minute? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins � dressed up, looking more like one of the students than a teacher. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"You look very pretty, Miss Collins. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It's awfully nice of you to say so. I know I'm not... not really... but thank you anyway. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I can't forget it. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It's very... nice. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. There's more. I don't know... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I think you're right. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Thank you. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,You won't. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I promised. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I'm sorry. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, That's okay. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,You want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything... 95 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, I've never been there. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Tommy... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I don't... I can't... I... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I'm sorry. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,It's just... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I don't know... anything. I can't dance... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,I don't even know how to... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Tommy... why? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Why am I here? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,With you. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Why? Why did you? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Why? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Oh. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,But... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, It's a fairy tale. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Tommy... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Do you want to? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,They're beautiful. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Who do we vote for? They're more your crowd than mine. 100 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"In fact, I don't really have a crowd. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,No. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,101 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Slowly looking up, seeing Tommy. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,They're not applauding for us. It can't be for us. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Don't. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Don't vote for us. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Don't. Please. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing � so hot and bright that it's impossible to see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Confused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise... 108 "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Her eyes tightly clenched shut, looking as if she's been dipped in a bucket of red paint. She's gotten the worst of it. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, as she starts toward the unconscious Tommy. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, hearing the dreaded laughter. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Putting her hands to her blood-covered face, slowly getting to her feet. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her tormentors. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Takes a deep breath, mustering her energy. She closes her eyes and sees: "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Closes her eyes even tighter and flexes. And � in SWISH PANS: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and never forget her. 113 "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Seeing the hose, getting the idea... NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys � "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," A smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing them � they're the ones being made to look foolish. She's standing on one side of the stage. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Realizing just what Ernest plans to do: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, No. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Watching this; another flex, and: "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding. She spots: "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, her heart pounding like an anvil. She's staring at: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, She flexes. 116 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Watching all this � a giggle  emerging from deep within her. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late. They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," As she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered... that Billy and Chris did it. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Turns around and sees it coming toward her. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," As the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back and forth, her arms thrown out. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Flexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her. It just misses her. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Her head pounding, flexing. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy, exhausted face � brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of the WHISTLE merging with SOUND OF SIRENS, and: "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Momma? Momma? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, Momma? 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Momma, I'm home. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,MOMMA! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Momma... 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ, She flings out her arms and cries out: 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Oh, Momma! "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ," Momma, it's not right. "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Momma, I love you. Please help me! "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,You. You tricked me. 123 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Get out. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Get out. 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,Get out! Get out! 
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,"Get out, get out, get out! "
CARRIE,CARRIEWHITE,ISFJ,GET OUT! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm not depressed. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm not depressed. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm not depressed! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why stop there? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm like the Keith Richards of cancer kids. The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm not sure it's for me. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""Journey?"" Really? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," DOCTOR Just give it a chance, ok? For me. Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she stands, sighs... "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I'm, uh, Hazel. 16. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Alright? I guess...? Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hmm? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why don't you guys go to a movie? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ugh. You can't make me. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"If you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"See, that's the kind of thing I would know with a fake ID. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Love you too Mom. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I'll take the stairs. The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Excuse me. With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face, Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead. Gus is now even more fixed on her than before. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right? The look on Gus's face is unreadable. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does. A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart. Gus laughs. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hazel. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why are you looking at me like that? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"What's with the ""always?"" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,He's gotta be hurting her boob. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Oh. Um. Uh... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"What do you mean ""now?"" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You could be an axe murderer. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're kidding right? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"What, you think that's cool? Oh you idiot! There's always a hamartia, isn't there? And yours is though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so well. As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Let me tell you... not being able to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"A fatal flaw. Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Sorry? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Metaphor. Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can't tonight. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You don't say. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm surprised you have a license. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Aha. Cancer perk. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I was 13 when they found it. And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly grown since... "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Yeah. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can't. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Got my GED. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's just... Hazel. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Nice to meet you! They walk down the carpeted stairs time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and weak lungs. Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Must have been pretty good. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Need to sit. Gus sits down next to her on the bed. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Don't get any ideas. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian lady, fainting-wise. Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I already told you my story. I was 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Um... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,No. I'm just... I don't know... un- extraordinary. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""An Imperial Affliction."" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's a novel. My favorite novel. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Seriously? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"It's not, it's... kind of my bible actually. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Cancer. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Not so much cold as under- oxygenated. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"By ""it"" do you mean herpes? Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly checks it "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm not worried. Please. It's not like I'm waiting for him to call or anything. I just... we hung out. No big deal. Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel rolls her eyes. CUT TO: 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Welcome to the sweet torture of reading ""An Imperial --"" At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other end of the phone. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What the -- are you ok? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"How ya doing Isaac? Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Oh I'm sorry. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Fair enough. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I actually think his response is appropriate. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," You're quoting my book! Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank Isaac. He finally speaks. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I know, right? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It is rather abrupt. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"But that's part of what I like about it. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. But I do to know what happens to everyone else. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,The Dutch Tulip Man... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I've written letters. He's never responded. Apparently he moved to Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't published anything. Doesn't do interviews. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hello Augustus. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What we need is a sequel. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,That's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,That's correct. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Yeee-up. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Unfortunately so. Gus clears his throat, smiles. Hazel waits. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Augustus!? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Keep reading, keep reading! "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You're making this up? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Holy hell. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can I... would you mind... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""I know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but I would just really like to know."" INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," ""And of course, if ever you do decide to write anything else, even if you don't want to publish it, I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd read your grocery lists. Yours with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster. Age 16."" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You think? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Is it really almost 1? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I gotta get to sleep. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok... Neither one of them want to hang up the phone. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok... They both laugh at this. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok. Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not convinced. CUT TO: 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Yeah. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Gets blood on the first try. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," ""I'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie."" They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"You doing alright, Isaac? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's a little crazy. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Was he? Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,The pain? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Holy shit! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam, do pay a visit at your leisure. Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten"" Son of a "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Nothing. Sorry. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Everything! Look! Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can we go to Amsterdam? Please? Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything. Forget I mentioned it. A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I've used it already. Pre- ""Miracle."" "

FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Gus? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"You ready Gus? Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You're not a virgin. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,He sounds Dutch. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Let me guess -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You do love your symbols. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It has crossed my mind. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I was thir-- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Sorry. Please, continue... "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,But I... didn't save it. Gus smiles. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Are you saying -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Wait a minute. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Cause I'd totally kiss you either way. And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over, they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Seriously... why are you doing this? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,He's not a stranger. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Don't be gross. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can we at least ask Dr. Maria? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You said the PET scan was encouraging! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,They have doctors in Amsterdam. And cancer. Someone will know what to do. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, So you'll come too. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,The Genies can hook it up. They're loaded. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"You've never been to Amsterdam, have you Mom? And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr. Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hi. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,So what happened? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Um, I feel like I'm not the most qualified person to answer that. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Can't I just get like a lung transplant or something? The Doctors look at one another like ""who wants to take that one?"" Eventually: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I have a question. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can I still go to Amsterdam? Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at him. He clears his throat. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why not? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Why not, Dr. Simmons? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,So does going to the mall -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,They have oxygen on airplanes. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," HAZEL It's my life, right? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I have this opportunity I may never have again. If the medicine's working, I don't see why -- "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hi Augustus. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Kind of. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I don't know. I want to go to Amsterdam. And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid. It's just... everything. Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of silence pass by. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Thanks for coming over. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's not about Amsterdam. It's about me. It's about... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Exactly. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children."" Gus laughs. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,No? Gus laughs harder. Hazel laughs with him. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Of course I like him. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's complicated. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Mom? No response. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Mom! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Sorry, I... I didn't know you were in the shower. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Did you ever call the Genies to tell them the trip is off? I just got an email from Peter Van Houton's assistant. She still thinks we're coming. Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly unsure what to say. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What? Frannie can't keep a straight face. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Really... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," One week, lungs. Keep your shit together one more week... "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Amsterdam! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"For what? Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another hug. Hazel lets him, laughing. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Mom? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok...? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Ok. Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just says, when they stop and look at her: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Amsterdam! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Oh that's not necessary. But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them. We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the attention until a LITTLE GIRL  appears. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"It's called a Cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe. The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I dunno. Wanna try? Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Right? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Well... I'd love to give you my cannula but... I kinda really need the help. The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly reattaches it. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I think that's us. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Have you never been on a plane before? Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's a metaphor. He puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok? Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,This is what it feels like to ride in a car with you. Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out the window 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"We're just friends, Mom. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Something like that. Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words, it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, This is Amsterdam? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Good morning. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,How was the park? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Mom! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What do you mean? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Mom... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery... is totally cool with you. Is that what you're saying? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, I... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok. They clink glasses and sip. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Wow that's good. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Thank you for letting me hijack your wish. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Oh my god. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I mean... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"There are no words. Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them and says something in Dutch. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I like your suit. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,That isn't the suit you wear to funerals? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's your death suit. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I have one of those. Bought it for my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd wear it on a date, though. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Watch it. Gus winks. CUT TO: LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat: 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Maybe. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Undecided. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,No. Well... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Really? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Maybe there is no point. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I hope you're right. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, AUGUSTUS -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Van Houten will get it. Trust me. There are like fifty Magritte references in ""Imperial Affliction."" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Exactly. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,No it's not. It's a drawing of a pipe. See? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why is the sky blue? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm so excited I can barely breathe. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Trash? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Um, no thanks. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Yes. We meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you. Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, Kinda. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,We have some questions -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"About what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind. Like her Mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy -- "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I would say... limited? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak Swedish. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"So anyway... when the book ends, Anna's mom -- "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Can we please, maybe, talk about Anna for a sec? I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue -- "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"- but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"They can't! (again, has to calm "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I don't want your pity -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hey listen douchepants. You're not gonna tell me anything I don't already know about illness. I need one thing and one thing only from you before I walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Bullshit! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Make something up. ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands, surprising everyone. After a beat: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You're really not gonna tell us? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Go fuck yourself. Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I spent your Wish on that asshole. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I wanted... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oh, um, that's alright. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I can do it. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, HAZEL I can do it! Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today. They are going inside. CUT TO: 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oh get over yourself. Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They shake their heads Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I love you, Augustus Waters. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""Get up you fat bastard."" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I said ""get up."" "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"God, what an asshole. They both giggle at the whole thing. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"It was awful, Mom. You can't imagine. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Then we went to the Anne Frank museum. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"We just... walked around. Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it in check in front of her Mother. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,That was weird. Gus doesn't respond except to say: 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Augustus? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oh no... Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth tightly, trying not to cry. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, HAZEL Oh god. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oh my god no! Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging him for dear life, her head in his lap. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's so unfair -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,It's so fucking unfair! A beat. Gus still trying not to cry. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Does it hurt? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm just... I'm very fond of you. He grabs her hand and holds it. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I don't think you're dying, Augustus. You've just got a touch of cancer. Gus nods. Squeezes her hand. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Gus had a recurrence. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You're not gonna say it? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"The usual. ""Everything happens for a reason..."" Michael shakes his head. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,How are your eyes? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What are you talking about? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, It would be an honor. They hold holds. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,How's your love life? Anything from Monica? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"She hasn't even like, texted to ask how you're doing? He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,That is so messed up! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,How do you even know that? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok now what? Gus smiles. CUT TO: 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac see a thing Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG. It misses the car by a mile. After a beat: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Woo hoo! Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,How's he doing? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What about the chemo? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Can I see him? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"If you don't mind, I'll just hang for a while. Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What are you thinking about? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Augustus... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You are. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I do know what you mean, I just... I don't agree. Hazel stands up, anger building. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,This obsession with being 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,But I am mad! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 93. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"You think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you, for everyone to remember you. Well guess what, Gus, this is your life. This is all you get. You get me, and your family, and this world. And if that's not enough, well I'm sorry, but it's not nothing. Cause I'll remember you, I'll love you -- "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,And I just wish... I just wish you'd be happy with that. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"It's not over yet, you know. Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there isn't much time. CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Hello? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,What? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I think it's infected... Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Gus, what the -- why are you here? Why aren't you home? Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his mouth away from his lap. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Oh, sweetie... "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I can't fix this. I have to call someone. I'm sorry. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Read you something? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I know one. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""The Red Wheelbarrow"" by William Carlos Williams. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,No of course not. Um... what else... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"So much depends upon this observer/ of the universe... As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Hi, Augustus. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I may have... 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Um... sure. Is everything -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I gotta go. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I can't, I have to meet Gus. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm not hungry. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I am aggressively unhungry, ok? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, HAZEL I have to go. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,No! 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I can't! I can't stay healthy because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am dying. I am going to die and leave you here alone and you won't have me to hover around and you won't be a mother anymore, and I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about it, ok?! Just leave me alone! Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately regrets this. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,When. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I worry that you won't have a life. That you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You are? Hazel is stunned. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"So when you're waiting for me outside Support Group or whatever, you're always -- "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why didn't you tell me? Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Are you kidding? Mom, this is awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my god! Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I'm so excited! You're gonna be so great, Mom! "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I know Mom. And I will. I promise. But right now... I really gotta go. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"I know, right? "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Late for what exactly? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Why now? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, How did you even get in here? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Um, no. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"""Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP," ""I can't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I love you."" Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"He loved you so much too. More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep breath, wills herself to walk towards it. Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee. Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches herself. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"It's ok, you hear me? It's ok. She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around. Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I was his girlfriend. Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"There's a beautiful quote in Gus's home that reads ""if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain."" Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'll be fine. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for a while. Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot. As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,How did you even -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,And you just... bought a ticket? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You read your fan mail now? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I'm so not in the mood -- 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Goodbye Mr. Van Houten. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Nope. Thanks though. Have a great life. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,She had leukemia? Like Anna? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Were you married then? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Well I'm sorry for your loss. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"You didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. We had an awesome trip. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"You think I care about that? I don't give a shit, Van Houten. Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,You're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. And I'd like you to get out of my car right now so I can go home and grieve. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"Get out of the car! Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands there as Hazel peels out. In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO: "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,"He was really fighting for breath, I guess. He eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. Dying sucks. "
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Happens all the time. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Very. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I know. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I know. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I didn't find it that annoying. They sit there in silence a few beats. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,He is not my friend and -- how do you know about that? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Yeah well I'm over it. I never want to read another word of that asshole's again. 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP, 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,I... I have to go. I... Are you...? 
FAULTINOURSTARS,HAZELGRACELANCASTER,INFP,Ok. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I told you I had a lot of relatives. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,They're waiting to see my father. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, You really want to know? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You like spaghetti? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off... "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, MICHAEL Then the legs at the knees... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Then the thighs where they joined the torso. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Then Luca turned to the other man... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I told you you wouldn't like him. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"My brother, Tom Hagen. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Thanks Tom. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Sure. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Tom said he'd take care of it. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,For bravery. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,For killing a man. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I fought for my country.  It was my choice. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'm going to finish school. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,And what do you want for Christmas? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," MICHAEL Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah... listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning.  There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas.  Will he be home tomorrow night? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,No. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, MICHAEL I'm thinking about it. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," MICHAEL No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, They don't say if he's dead or alive. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Thanks. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, You heard from Tom yet? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, C'mon. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,How's Mom? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I can help you out... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,What? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,How can you be sure? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Is it going to be all-out war, like last time? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, That's not how Pop would have played it. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," All right, Sonny.  All right. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Is it like they say?  Is he that good? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Hello.  Kay? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,He'll be OK. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Yeah Kay, I'm here. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Huh? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I can't... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,To the city. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I don't think so either. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Goodbye. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Hello?  Hello? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You just stand here one minute... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, I won't panic. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Hurry, into there. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, Who is it? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Enzo, get out of here.  There's going to be trouble. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Go outside; stand in front...I'll be out in a minute. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh, don't try to speak.  There are men who are coming to try to kill you. But I'm with you...I'm with you now... "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Listen... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"(deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Christ, Sonny really means business. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Cut it out. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather.  He took my joining the Marines personal.  I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,How bad will it be? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,A million times. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,We're going to New Jersey? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Now I can talk.  I feel much better. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Don Tommassino. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I know. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Corleone. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Don Tommassino...I should see this place. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,No...I would like to walk to Corleone. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,How do you know I come from America? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Only the son of a Pezzonovanta. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Yes. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, Shhhhh. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,What are you talking about? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair.  She looks more Greek than Italian.  Do you know a beauty like that? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Innkeeper.  More wine! 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Tell him to come to me. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter.  I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well.  Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her... "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country.  My name is Michael.  You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter.  With your permission and under the supervision of your family.  With all decorum.  With all respect.  I am an honorable man. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Your daughter's name? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,It's safer to teach you English. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Ciao, Don Tommassino. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Things went badly in Palermo? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Is that why there are more men on the walls? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,What is it? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks... "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, Where the hell is he going? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,No.  No! 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, No. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You wanted me to be your son. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Then why have I become a man like you? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"You look good, too. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, No. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Come here a minute, Fredo. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Who are those girls? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Give them some money and send them home. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Get rid of them... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Johnny, the Corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the Olive Oil business and settling here.  Moe Greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started.  We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers.  We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same.  We count on you to convince them. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Thanks. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Is my credit good enough to buy you out? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, You're unlucky. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You straightened my brother out? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Freddie, you're my older brother. I love you.  But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"No, you eat...don't wait up for me. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Let HER ask. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'm busy. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Let me think about it, O.K.? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada; you'll be my right-hand man out there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Maybe less... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,No.  I want things very calm for another six months. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,All I can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets.  Understood? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'll come to you when I need you. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"All right, then it's resolved. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,How did you find out? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Not so perfectly if you noticed. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," You're out, Tom. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'm going to talk to my father. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'll need him. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,How? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Yes. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I've always respected you... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,He talked to you? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I know now. (a passion wells up inside of MICHAEL) I'll make them call me Don. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,But after the Baptism.  I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Yes, I promise. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I do renounce him. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I do renounce them. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I do wish to be baptized. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"Carlo...we've had a change in the plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Go back to your house and wait for me... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, I'll just be a couple of days... 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You have to answer for Santino. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini? "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, Speak your mind. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,No.  This I have to do. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Sit in the car. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Where's the boss? 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ," She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL and KAY. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Get her home and get a doctor. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,She's hysterical. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,Don't ask me. 
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ,"All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time. "
GODFATHER,MICHAELCORLEONE,INTJ, No. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I know who you are. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,How did he die? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No.  I'm an amateur. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,About a year and a half. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Yes. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Yes. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Yes.  I liked fucking him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I don't really feel like talking anymore. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.  Please. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Are you arresting me? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Can I change into something more appropriate?  It'll just take a minute. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Come in. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,How long will this take? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Only when they make interesting reading. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I'm ready. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Why would I need an attorney? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Do you have a cigarette? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Yes, you do. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I found some in my purse; would you like one? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,It won't last. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Yes I am. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,It teaches you to lie. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,She kills him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No thank you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Did I miss something? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Why did you think I wouldn't want one? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I have nothing to hide. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,He wasn't afraid of experimenting. I like men like that.  I like men who give me pleasure.  He gave me a lot of pleasure. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No. Johnny liked to use his hands too much.  I like hands and fingers. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Yes it does, doesn't it? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,The answer is no.  I didn't kill him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Sometimes. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Sure. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Cocaine. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Have you ever fucked on cocaine? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Yes it was.  Bobby died. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I loved him.  I hurt. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,That's right. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Maybe I was guessing.  What difference does it make? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Would you like a cigarette, Nick? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock star.  I went down to his club and picked him up.  Then I had sex with him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Would you like me to take a lie detector test? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Can I go now? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Can I ask one of you for a ride? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Thanks. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I'm tired. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," I love the rain, don't you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"You see?  We're both innocent, Nick. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,You know all about me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Thanks for the ride. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Hi. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No.  Come in. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"I'm using you for my detective. In my book.  You don't mind, do you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," That's right.  You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"I'd like to ask you some, too. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,For my book. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,How does it feel to kill someone? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I don't know.  But you do. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Four shootings in five years.  All accidents. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,There's a name from the past. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Only in theory. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The day you shot those two tourists -- how much coke did you do? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Tell me, Nick. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Your wife knew, didn't she?  She knew what was going on.  Nicky got too close to the flame.  Nicky liked it. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, That's why she killed herself? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Hiya, hon.  You two have met, haven't you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"You're going to make a terrific character, Nick. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I heard about what happened.  What good's a shooter without his gun? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Do you? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I didn't think you'd ask me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Why not? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Not me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,You should put some warmth into it.  You don't want it to reflect on your personality. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Fine. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Please. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Let me do that.  You like to watch me doing it, don't you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Can I have a cigarette, please?  I told you you'd start smoking again. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Light it for me, will you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Thank you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"(doesn't look at him) Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,What if I call you Nicky? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," I know, Nicky, but I like it. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," It's not the same thing, is it? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Say -- ""What do you want from me, Catherine?"" "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I brought you something. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Aren't you going to thank me? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,To see if he can get away with it. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, You mean did I write it before my parents died? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No.  I wrote it years afterwards. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Good.  I'd miss you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Why take the risk? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Thanks for the drink. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Hi, Gus. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Nicky. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, She's seen me fuck plenty of other guys. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,She's seen everything before. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Did you think it was so special? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I thought it was a pretty good beginning. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Do you want her to join us sometime? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'm not as judgmental about women as I am about men. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Fine.  How's your back? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"We're alike, you know. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Not unless you confuse my character with my body parts. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Were you frightened, Nicky? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I told you I had a vivid imagination. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,You shouldn't play this game. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, You're in over your head. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"I've got a book to write.  I'll see you around, Shooter. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Catherine! 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Do you think I told her to kill You? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"(after a beat, near tears) Everybody that I care about dies. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"(quietly, almost begging) Make love to me. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I never have before. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Isn't it just beautiful?  I love it here like this. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,No. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games! "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,You won't believe me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,About three months before I met you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Maybe I'm losing interest in my book. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Do you believe me? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'll convince you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Hello? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,It's Gus-who-doesn't-like-me. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,What did he say? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Funny. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"Hazel , this is Nick.  I told you all about him.  This is Hazel Dobkins. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Of course I knew. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Look.  Sometimes when I do my research, I get involved with people.  It happened with you, too. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Killing isn't like smoking.  You can quit. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," I've go to go.  I promised to get her home by six o'clock.  She just loves ""America's Most Wanted."" "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"What were you doing, checking up on me?  What for? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Henderson. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Do I scare you, Nick? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I just thought I'd surprise you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Did you?  What's she doing? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,You're not going to tell me what she's doing. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,And you believed her?  I even went down to the campus  police and made out a report about her. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"You still think I kill people, don't you? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Liar. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I decided to give you one more chance. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Did you miss me? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Come over here and tell me no. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Not yet it isn't. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,But we're getting there. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I'm very good at research.  I'll help you. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,What are you researching? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Really.  What are you writing about. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, What happens to them? 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, It won't sell. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Somebody has to die. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Somebody always does. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I finished my book. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I told you.  She kills him. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," Goodbye, Nick. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I finished my book. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ," The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter. "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,Right there. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I heard about it... on TV. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I can't allow myself to care about you -- I can't allow myself to care -- I can't -- I can't -- 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I don't want to do this -- please -- I don't want to do this -- I lose everybody -- I don't want to lose you -- I don't want to -- 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,"What do we do now, Nick? "
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ,I hate rugrats. 
BASICINSTINCT,CATHERINETRAMELL,ENTJ, I love you. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Watson.    Perfect timing. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Just got it.    Where's Lestrade? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I don't know.    It's an old shirt. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Right.    Shall we? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,No. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Look. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Look. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Impeccable timing, Lestrade. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, We've gone for the doctor... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Please... Watson, I've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Please... Don't, don't, don't... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Gently, gently, Watson... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Is it poisoned, nanny? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,He'll be right as a trivet in no time. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Nothing. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Absolutely. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Wonderful. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,My favorite. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Not available. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Have you proposed yet? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Then it's not official. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Fashionably. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take Watson... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"... see that walking-stick? A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets... ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Yes, right behind you. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Yes, I doubt -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You insist? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Your student's a boy of 8. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It's breathing. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,He flicked ink at you today. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly -- which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes. Holmes pauses... pauses, then: "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You were engaged. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,She's lovely. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Well done.   Thank you. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Hm.   Plymouth gin. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I find that it lifts my spirits. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"That's your job, not mine. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Look at that structure. What has it been? Five years' work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary bet -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"You're right... I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,So that's a `no' to the opera then? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It's too small for you. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Where are all the other prisoners? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Love what you've done with the place. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,A small point of concern. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," BLACKWOOD So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Bon voyage, Blackwood. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Nothing. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,But your signature is clear. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Ah, the Maharajah's missing diamond. Another souvenir? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"And you, husbands. No ring? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Should I answer chronologically or alphabetically? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Who are you working for? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Keep your money. I didn't say I'd take the case. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Allow me to explain. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Thank you, I -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I don't believe -- 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You've had your fun. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Now it's time to press on. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Now it's time to press on. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It doesn't matter -- 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Regrettably, we've had our last case together. Those are my dates. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Midget! 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"No, I don't agree. It's more than a technicality. You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"No, I'm just saying, one has disproportionate limbs the other does not. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Will you allow me to explain. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Now, that's the Irene I know. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"She's intimidated, scared... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Clarky! 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It is not my reputation at stake here. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Scotland Yard at their finest, once again. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,And the coffin? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Inspector, may I see your pen? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"All yours, Inspector. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Now the game is afoot, Watson. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Trust me. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"(mouth full, near indecipherable) Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Excellent. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,The most recent is M.H... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I think not. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Do you have any changes? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Why, do you -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Reordon's lodgings should be right around this bend. Here we are... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh, well, give my regards to Mary. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,He clearly felt something was coming to get him. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"(inhaling deeply, loving it) Ammonium sulfate. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Phosphorous... Formaldehyde... Hemlock... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Irene was here. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. Something he was working on? WATSON Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"There's one odor I can't put my finger on. Sweet, almost like perfume... or sugar.... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Hello, gentlemen. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, HOLMES Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"(theatrically indignant) You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self- defense. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You've never complained about my methods before. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,That was an accident... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,The first time WAS an accident... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Gladstone's my dog as well.   It's in the interest of science. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"And you, sir, an excellent policeman. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,All in good time. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Who's this? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Yes.   They're almost interesting. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Fear is the more infectious condition. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Blackwood is your son, yes? You have the same colored irises -- a rare dark green, with diamond- shaped hazel flecks -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Evidently. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"One of the great benefits of my work is that I can pick and choose my clients. I'll get him, but not for you. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I have one last question, Sir Thomas. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"If the rest of his family's dead, why are you still alive? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You can stop looking for Reardon. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,He was buried in Blackwood's tomb. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results? You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor perhaps? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,We're not. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Tell me who you're working for and what he's after. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I disagree. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,So what's it to be? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"You're in over your head this time, Irene. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,How can you live like this -- always a fugitive. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Don't take this the wrong way, but might I borrow your hand? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Faith runs riot over reason. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Why did you drain the water? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Hmm... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,What is that? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay! "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, I have no    idea what to make of that. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Don't forget the wallpaper. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Figure of speech. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Since this room is no longer in use, do you mind if I employ it? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Bring him in, boys. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,My new roommate. He's an inspiring conversationalist. (alt: He has more humor than you.) 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"No, he's your friend from Reordon's. He didn't survive Dredger landing on him. Poor fellow. But there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Elbows and arms stained with blood, but older than his own injuries. Plenty of it, layer on layer... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Though none of it human. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,A butcher perhaps...?   What else? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Coal... river silt... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Well done. Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,See what Blackwood admits to owning. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Something brutal by the river... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"That's it, Watson! This should lead us right to Blackwood. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Right. Well uh... best of luck with everything, then. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Everything all right, Captain Tanner? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the police when you get there. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,What are you doing with my gun? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It was an honest mistake -- 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"The one on the left seems more attentive, might prove easily distracted. The big one's been drinking -- whether for courage or from habit... Watson? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"They cleared something out of here, not minutes ago... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"It's chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I am He that liveth, and was dead.' "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It's your turn in shackles this time. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I've been meaning to ask you something -- 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the flames hit them. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain you're not in over your head? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP," Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You owe me information. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Watson! 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM! 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!! 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,From Lord Coward? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Thank you, Clarky. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at Holmes' head. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Writing and sweating on the bed in the attic. Holmes sees a hazy image of Irene. She leans over him smiling sweetly then wraps her hands around his neck and starts to strangle him. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Watson...? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,What about the shrapnel in your arm? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"(quietly, between them) She brought you here? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"The fair sex was always your department, Watson. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Thank you. You know, I dreamt that you were strangling me. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,What time is it? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Excellent brew, but I believe my head requires something a bit stronger to clear the -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Exactly. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I need a map of London. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map! "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years -- and not by coincidence. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It is the fifth element -- the ethereal. That which can't yet be known. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Ladies first. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Follow these plans. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I'm curious, Coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders or just the one I prevented? Very distinctive those hand-made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Nonetheless, I confess to being completely out-matched. I could deduce very little from my investigation. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"No, but I don't care much what you think. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, But your clothes say infinitely more than you ever hope. The mud smeared on your boots from where you've been walking... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Well there's no time to waste then, is there? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Performed his role perfectly.   A little too perfectly, come to think of it. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Watson, did you bring my clothes? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Trust me, have a drink. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Behold, Blackwood's magic. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,No.   I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Seven minutes to twelve... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I wouldn't. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Take this. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,There's never been anything like it. A totally wire-free weapon. He must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite -- 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, Keep at it. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the bullets. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"We need a light, a match -- "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Yes... it was. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Yes, we made it. Just. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Woman! Sherlock appears behind her, winded. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,It's bad manners to leave without at least saying `goodbye.' 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Why hurry off, give it a try. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP, High above:   a RAVEN lands. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,There was never any magic.   Only conjuring tricks. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"(guard choking/ payoff) Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. (burial ground/ licking rocks) Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. (bath/Reordon flashback) Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"First, the world will see you for what you are. Then you will hang... properly this time. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,We'll see about that shall we. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Oh, Irene... "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,We've still got a moment. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Sadly, yes. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Thank you, Lestrade. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,She won't be by the time your boys get there. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook -- I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come down. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own. It is known locally as -- 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,-- mad honey disease. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"What is it this time, Clarky? "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Were there powder burns on his eyebrows? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,With small caliber bullet. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Moriarty. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I'd wager there's a piece missing. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,The wire-free invention was the game all along. Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio waves. 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"I'll leave with you.   Clarky, case reopened. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Were there powder burns on his eyebrows? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Where is Blackwood's device now? 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Wager, Watson... I thought those days were behind you. Excellent deduction, however. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,Blackwood's wire-free invention was the game all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,I'll walk out with you... 
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"An honor working with you, Doctor. "
SHERLOCKHOLMES,SHERLOCKHOLMES,ENTP,"Magnificent woman, Watson. Magnificent! "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,What Mr. Cobb is trying to say- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Yes. In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. It's called extraction. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,He knows. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,What's going on up there? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Saito knows. He's playing with us. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"What's she doing here, Cobb? "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,See that you do. We're here to work. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I know! We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I'm not going to make it! Wake Cobb! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Dunk him! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"They're getting closer, Cobb. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Come on, Cobb. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Not good. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,How could you get the carpet wrong?! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You're the architect- 17. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,And you-what the hell was all that? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I'd hate to see out of control- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Why? He's not gonna search every compartment. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I can keep him under for one minute- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Our ride's on the roof. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Cobb... are you okay? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Down in the dream... Mal showing up like that ... 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"It's getting worse, isn't it? "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Hasn't shown. Wanna wait? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Where will you go? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Stateside. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Of course not. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Okay, here's planting an idea: I say to you, ""Don't think about elephants."" "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Cobb, come on- "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Cobb, we should walk away from this. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I know how much you want to go home- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,But this can't be done. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You don't know that!- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Did it work? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Who did you do it to? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,So why are we headed to Paris? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"That's why the military developed dream sharing-a training program where soldiers could strangle, stab and shoot each other, then wake up. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,It's okay. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Some kind of personal icon. A small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows, "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"So. A totem. You need something small, potentially heavy... "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Too common. You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,A loaded die. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I can't let you handle it. That's the point. No one else can know the weight or balance of it. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,So when you examine your totem... 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Why not? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Where will you be? 40. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's backyard. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,There are plenty of other thieves. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,42. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,He said you'd be back. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,But there's nothing else quite like it. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,See... 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Paradox. A closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city. But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,And the better the maze- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"I don't know if he can't, but he won't. He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,He won't tell me. I think it's Mal. I think she's getting stronger. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,She's not his ex. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What you see in there is just his projection of her. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ, She was lovely. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,How deep? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,A dream within a dream within a dream? Is that even possible? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Might? We'll have to do better than that. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ," ARTHUR Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,How do you produce these emotional triggers? 59. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Are those yours? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Yusuf? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ, So he gives himself the idea. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Eames, I'm impressed. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,It'd have to be a 747. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin. We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant- "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,My question is how we go down three layers with enough stability. Three layers down a little turbulence is gonna translate into an earthquake. The dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,How do we get out once we've made the plant? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,But how are we going to feel that through the sedation? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Even that won't cut through three layers of deep sleep. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,We can use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ, Couldn't you have peed before you went under? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Everybody okay? Saito? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I don't know. What happened back there? Where were you? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ, Why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Fischer's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself. His subconscious is militarized. It should've shown on the research- 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Calm down. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security before. We just have to be more- "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Unconstructed dream space. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before. On this team... just Cobb. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Let's just get him upstairs. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Hold this. Firm pressure. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You knew the risks and you didn't tell us. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You had no right. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,And you. You went along with this? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You trusted him? When? When he promised you half his share? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb? "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"In. your lather's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe. We need the combination. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,We have it on good authority that you do. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Good authority. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,The combination. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Why would Browning tell us you did? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,That helps us? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,But how do you reconcile them if they're that estranged? 96. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"Well, work fast-Fischer's projections are closing in quick, we need to break out of here before we're totally boxed in... "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,What about his security? It's going to get worse as we go deeper. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,No. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,A bad idea. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Sure. But it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"And don't make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back, we have to be ready to catch it- "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,And there goes Mr. Charles. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Because it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming. Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,You must've noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do. 100. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream. That's making his subconscious look for the dreamer. For me. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"So, if everything's correct, this room should be directly below 528. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"No, I have to judge it myself. Once you're all asleep up in room 528, I wait `til Yusuf starts his kick... "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"His music warns me it's coming, then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that's when I blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick. Too soon, and we won't get pulled out; too late and I won't be able to drop us. "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,The van will be in free fall. I can't drop us with no gravity. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Mr. Charles! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Shhhh! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,He's out. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ, He's going to help us break into his own subconscious. 112. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I'll lead them on a merry chase. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,I'm on it. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Hey! 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,"No, Yusuf. Too soon! "
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,Paradox. 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,How the hell do I drop you? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,What happened? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,With Mal? 
INCEPTION,ARTHUR,ISTJ,He'll be lost...

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"Is this Ms. Glasser's sixth period French? Some of the students laugh, most just turn back to their friends as Frank nervously adjusts his tie. A GIRL in the front row stares at Frank. "
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"Open your books to chapter eight, read quietly to yourselves. The classroom door swings open, and a frail, confused TEACHER walks in and motions to Frank. "

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,I suggest you start reading people. 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,It's a fake. 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,There's no crease in the paper. 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"When your mom hands you a note to miss school, you put it in your pocket. And if it was in his pocket, where's the crease? "

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"Wait. Frank walks to the couch, picks up a small ROTARY PIN that is lying on the cushions. He holds it up to Jack. "

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free hand, but doesn't open it. "
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,Counterfeiting is our thing. 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,Don't worry about it. 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"Tough luck, Joe. Five minutes earlier and you would have landed yourself a pretty good collar. Frank starts walking down the stairs. "

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"We're gonna have it all, Brenda. "
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,The same place everyone gets it. The bank.

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"Every bank uses hand stamps for the dates. They get used over and over, so they're always worn down, and the numbers are always cracking -- the sixes and nines go first.

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,It's a fake. 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,"There's no perforated edge, which means this check was hand cut, not fed. The paper is double bonded, much too heavy for a check. The ink is raised against my fingers instead of flat. Frank brings the check to his nose, sniffs it. "
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,I already have a job here. I deliver the mail.

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,I'd rather stay in a hotel.

CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. Would it be okay if I went to work with you? 
CATCHMEIFYOUCAN,FRANKABAGNALEJR,ESTP,Joe. . .what do I do until Monday?

GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"One, don't do that.  Two -- you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, Maybe. But at least I won't be a prick. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"If you change your mind, I'll be over by the bar. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'm Will. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I kind of got that impression. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, SKYLAR Maybe we could go out for coffee sometime? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Five minutes. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I was trying to be smooth. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,The caramel thing is my pick-up line. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Hold up. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Hey! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,DO YOU LIKE APPLES? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,DO YOU LIKE APPLES?! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA LIKE THEM APPLES?!! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"There is a lengthy legal precedent, Your Honor, going back to 1789, whereby a defendant may claim self- defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to be a defense against tyranny, a defense of liberty-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit back in 1887, that ""Every American citizen is by birth, a sworn officer of the state.

GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump. "

GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caesar, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.

GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Keep up the good work, Maureen. Vinnie? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't your brother give you the notes? Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you then they won't feel safe enough to be honest with you -- then there's no point to them being in therapy. It's like saying -- ""Fine, come here and don't tell me a thing but go home feeling like you're doing something about your problems -- and give me my fifty bucks before you leave will ya'!"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"If you don't help them trust you -- then there's no way you'll ever get them to sleep with you. And that should be the goal of any good therapist. Insecure women, you know... nail 'em when they're vulnerable, that's always been my motto. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"See, I got Vinnie's attention. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Gerry.

GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Good to see you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I bet your parents were happy to pay. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Is Harvard gettin' all that money? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,So you just want to use me and go? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"In that case, fine. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,It works better when I have my rabbit. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I've been busy. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Since Nancy died.

GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Hey, look lady, I'm just here for the free food. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Not much free time, Gerry. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Yeah.

GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Why me? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,My kind of background? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Five. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Who? Barry, Henry, Rick... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Can we do it at my office? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I got it. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I'll be okay. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, let's let the healing begin. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Would you excuse us? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"You too, Gerry. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Where are you from in Southie? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a ""shrink kit"" that comes with all these volumes included? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Have you read all these books, Will? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Probably not. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP, How about the ones on that shelf? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, I read those. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,What did you think? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.  They're your books, why don't you read 'em? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I did. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,That must have taken you a long time. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Yeah, it did take me a long time. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," ""A History of the United States, Volume I."" If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States."" That book will knock you on your ass. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"How about Noam Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent?"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You think so? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Whatever blows your hair back. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP, Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Do you lift? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Yes, I do. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Nautilus? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Free weights. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,285. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Oh. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You paint this? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Yeah. Do you paint? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Crayons? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,This is a real piece of shit. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Tell me what you really think. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,What does? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,What is? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Oh, ""Starry Night"" time, huh? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"You ever heard the saying, ""any port in a storm?"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Sure, how 'bout ""still waters run deep""- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"--Well, maybe that means you. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Maybe what mea-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Maybe you were in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the waves were crashing over the bow, the Goddamned mast was about to snap, and you were crying for the harbor. So you did what you had to do, to get out.  Maybe you became a psychologist. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Maybe you should be a patient and sit down. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Maybe you married the wrong woman. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Watch your mouth. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"How are the seas now, D-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,If you ever disrespect my wife again... I will end you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Time's up. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"At ease, gentlemen. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure the kid is here. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Not far from here, South Boston. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Pretty boring, I guess. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"You know, nothing special. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You wouldn't believe me if I told you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I have twelve big brothers. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I swear to God. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"'Course I do, they're my brothers. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,We'll do that. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You again. How the paintin' coming? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Come with me. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why thank you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You've never been out of Boston. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written... Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you.  And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term ""visiting hours"" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw.  You must know everything about me.  You're an orphan, right? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Do you think I would presume to know the first thing about who you are because I read ""Oliver Twist?"" And I don't buy the argument that you don't want to be here, because I think you like all the attention you're getting. Personally, I don't care. There's nothing you can tell me that I can't read somewhere else.  Unless we talk about your life. But you won't do that. Maybe you're afraid of what you might say. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,It's up to you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No one. I didn't have the number. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"No, it was your mother's 900 number. I just ran out of quarters. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,No smoking. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I won't talk first. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"How you doin', Krystyn. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why not? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'm takin' off. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'm tired. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like ""we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet,"" and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says ""man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee.""  So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes ""don't forget the coffee!"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP, You've never been on a plane. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I have been laid you know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Yeah? You got a lady now? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, I went on a date last week. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,How'd it go? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Fine. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Well, are you going out again? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I don't know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Why not? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Haven't called her. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Jesus Christ, you are an amateur. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"So Christ, call her up. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Well, I think that's a great philosophy Will, that way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"My wife used to turn the alarm clock off in her sleep. I was late for work all the time because in the middle of the night she'd roll over and turn the damn thing off. Eventually I got a second clock and put it under my side of the bed, but it got to where she was gettin' to that one too. She was afraid of the dark, so the closet light was on all night. Thing kept me up half the night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, out of sheer exhaustion and not wake up when I was supposed to cause she'd have already gotten to my alarms. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"My wife's been dead two years, Will. And when I think about her, those are the things I think about most. Little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about.  Those made her my wife. And she had the goods on me too. Little things I do out of habit. People call these things imperfections Will. It's just who we are. And we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds. You're not perfect. And let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either. The question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other. You can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin' that one out is by giving it a shot. You sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me. And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why not? You told me every other fuckin' thing. You talk more than any shrink I ever met. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You ever think about gettin' remarried? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,My wife's dead. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Hence, the word remarried. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,My wife's dead. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Time's up. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I'm sorry, I been real busy. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Promise? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I couldn't wait till tomorrow. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse in the mouth? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Then let's go have some fun. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Really? How'd the date go? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Do you still counsel veterans? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"No, I don't. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why not? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I gave that up when my wife got sick. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Is that why you didn't write anything else? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP," I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Yeah. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What happened to that guy from Kentucky? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"No, that's okay. It's an important question. 'Cause you'll have your bad times, which wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to.  And you can fail, as long as you're trying hard. But there's nothing worse than regret. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You don't regret meetin' your wife? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,When did you know she was the one? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl.  What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Where were you? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I was havin' a drink with my future wife. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,That's right. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,And what kind of friends are these? They let you get away with that? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I just slid my ticket across the table and said ""sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"""I gotta go see about a girl""? What did they say? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,They could see that I meant it. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're kiddin' me. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up counseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Would have been nice to catch that game though. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP," Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,But I can always go to the other side. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Look, I wrote it down. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,It's just simpler this way. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,'Cause it's nicer than my place. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Exactly. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,They don't come over here that much. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Aah, it's kind of a hike. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"All right, all right. We'll go. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Sometime. I don't know. Next week. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'd say... 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Then on behalf of my wiener, I'd like to ask for an advance. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I don't know what the fuck you're doin'.  You're givin' us a ride. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I was countin' on it. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Thanks, Chuck. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Not tonight. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,They're all sleepin' now. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"So she goes runnin' up the aisle and I figure ""fuck it"" and I yell out ""don't forget the coffee! "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Gerry! Any trouble finding the place? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Could we get a couple of sandwiches? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,(pulls out lottery ticket) I got the winning numbers right here. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Twelve million. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I live right around the corner. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I been here a couple years. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You wanted to talk about Will? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I think so. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,We haven't really gotten into it. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Jobs doing what? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"That's great, Gerry, that there's interest -- But I'm not sure he's ready for that. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,What don't I understand? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Thanks, Timmy. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,He married his cousin. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Einstein. Had two marriages, both trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum- possible Unabomber addition-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I do. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Just... take it easy, Gerry. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Maybe he doesn't care about that. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Now wait a minute, Gerry-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,How's it goin'? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Want me to take a look? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're rich. What do you have to worry about? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Some, a little. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I guess so. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Like me? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Do you play the piano? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,When it came to stuff like that I could always just play. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,!!! ! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I don't know what it's called. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'm pretty sure it's right. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,It's right. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my chief negotiator. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Then don't set up any more meetings. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Well, I'm sorry. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,How do you know that? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, but how do you know? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,And you're sure about that? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like ""hey this is a big mistake."" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I can't go out to California. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"One, because I have a job here and two because I live here-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"What do you mean ""What am I afraid of?"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What am I scared of? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,At least you have a mother. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What the fuck am I afraid of?! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'm not honest? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"No, you don't want to hear that. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You don't want to hear that. Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says ""save me"" on my back? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I don't love you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Codebreaking. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I just wanted to call before you left. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Yeah. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, A beat. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Take care. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Pudge Fisk. You follow baseball? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean told me. It's a long story. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You all set? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Yeah. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,So you might be working for Uncle Sam. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I don't know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Gerry says the meeting went well. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I guess. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,What did you think? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What did I think? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well.  But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed.  Now the politicians are sayin' ""send in the Marines to secure the area"" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.  And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic. So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure I'll eliminate the middle man. Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? Christ, I could be elected President. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Do you think you're alone? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Do you have a soul-mate? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Define that. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Someone who challenges you in every way.  Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Yeah. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,They're all dead. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Not to me, they're not. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"But you can't give back to them, Will. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Don't give me your line of shit. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I didn't want the job. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I didn't ask for this. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"And when they get drunk and puke in the sink, they don't have to see it the next morning because of you. That's real work, Will. And there is honor in that.  Which I'm sure is why you took the job. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I just want to know why you decided to sneak around at night, writing on chalkboards and lying about it. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Something you want to say? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Why don't you come back when you have an answer for me. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Fuck you! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Who the fuck are you to lecture me about life? You fuckin' burnout! Where's your ""soul-mate?!"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Dead! She dies and you just cash in your chips. That's a fuckin' cop- out! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I been there. I played my hand. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Look at me. What do you want to do? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You and your bullshit. You got an answer for everybody. But I asked you a straight question and you can't give me a straight answer. Because you don't know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Gone. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,She went to Medical school in California. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Fuck you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Week after I'm twenty-one. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Chuckie, what are you talkin'... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You don't know that. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Now wait a minute-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,--Gerry-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Hold on! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"""Undermine?"" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,He is at a fragile point. He's got problems-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Why do you think he does that, Gerry? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him! "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,--I'm not angry at you-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,--I don't have any anger at you-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions!  Because I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And your Goddamn Medal! "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I don't blame you! It's not about that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him- won't see you make him feel like a failure too! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"If you push him into something, if you ride him-- "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,He's not you! 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I can come back. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Well, I'm here. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way. And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Do you want to talk about it? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,What's that? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're not going to fail me are you? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,So what's it say? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You want to read it? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,No. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Twenty years of counseling you see a lot of-- 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"No, have you had any experience with that? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Yes. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, It sure ain't good. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP, My dad used to make us walk down to the park and collect the sticks he was going to beat us with. Actually the worst of the beatings were between me and my brother. We would practice on each other trying to find sticks that would break. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"He used to just put a belt, a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say ""choose."" "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Gotta go with the belt there... 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I used to go with the wrench. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"The wrench, why? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Cause fuck him, that's why. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Is that why me and Skylar broke up? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I didn't know you had. Do you want to talk about that? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,This is not your fault. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," Oh, I know. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,It's not your fault. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, I know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,It's not your fault. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,It's not your fault. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, I know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,It's not your fault. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Don't fuck with me. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"(comes around desk, sits in front of Will) It's not your fault. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, I know. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,It's not... 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," I know, I know... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, my name is Will Hunting. I'm here about a position. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Sorry to miss this. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, You and Morgan throw? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Why didn't you yoke him? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're kiddin' me. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,You're kiddin' me. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, How the fuck did you guys do this? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"So, you finally got a job Morgan? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Which one did you take, Will? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,That's what you want? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Yeah, I think so. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Good for you. Congratulations. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Thanks you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,We're done. You did your time. You're a free man. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"I just want you to know, Sean... "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"You're Welcome, Will. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I'll keep in touch. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I just... figured it's time I put my money back on the table, see what kind of cards I get. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"I'll be checking in with my machine at the college. If you ever need anything, just call. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Do what's in your heart, son. You'll be fine. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Thanks you, Sean. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,No. Thank you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP, Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Only if you grab my ass. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,See ya. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Good luck. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," WILL Hey, how you doin'? "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Thank you. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,Bullshit. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,I appreciate that. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Hey, Gerry. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP,"Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Come in. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP, SEAN 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I don't know. India maybe. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Never been. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,(picks up a flyer from his desk) I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You should come. I'll buy you a drink. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP, A beat. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"Hell, I know that. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,Sounds good. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,"It's on you though, until eight o'clock tonight when I win my money. "
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one. 
GOODWILLHUNTING,SEANMAGUIRE,INFP,You're pretty quick with those numbers.  How about the odds of me buying the first round? 
GOODWILLHUNTING,WILLHUNTING,INTP," Sean -- If the Professor calls about that job, just tell him, ""Sorry, I had to go see about a girl."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Thank you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Hello Mr. Nolan. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Thank you, sir. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I'll do my best sir. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I'm Neil Perry. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Todd Anderson. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Why'd you leave Balincrest? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,My brother went here. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Oh, so you're that Anderson. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Hey, how's it going Neil? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Hey Knox. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Yeah, sure. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his foot in his mouth. You know what I mean? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Rumor has it, you did summer school. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead. How was your summer Slick? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Keen. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Meeks. Door. Closed. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study group. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind including him? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Come on, he's your roommate. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,That's not my fault. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Oh, this is Todd Anderson. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Nice to meet you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Charlie Dalton. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Knox Overstreet. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a genius like Meeks. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"And English, and Trig. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,It's open. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Father, I thought you'd gone. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,But I'm the assistant editor this year. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Father, I wasn't disputing- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Yes sir. I'm sorry. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Yes sir. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Why doesn't he let you do what you want? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr. Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You guys are the same way. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,What I have to do. Drop the annual. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Yes. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Yeah, come along pal. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Thanks. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Hey Spaz, Spaz. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Well come on. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"""Oh Captain, My Captain"" who knows where that comes from? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or, if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain, My Captain. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Now let me dispel a few rumors so they don't fester into facts. Yes, I too attended Hell-ton and survived. And no, at that time I was not the mental giant you see before you. I was the intellectual equivalent of a ninety-eight pound weakling. I would go to the beach and people would kick copies of Byron in my face. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Now, Mr� Pitts. That's a rather unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are you? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first stanza of the poem you find there? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Yes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate, isn't it. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you Mr. Pitts. ""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."" The Latin term for that sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows what that means? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Very good, Mr.- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Meeks. Another unusual name. Seize the day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. Why does the writer use these lines? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Because he's in a hurry. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, ding! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you for playing anyway. Because we are food for worms lads. Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Now I would like you to step forward over here and peruse some of the faces from the past. You've walked past them many times. I don't think you've really looked at them. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones, just like you. Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you. Their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because you see gentlmen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP, Carpe. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Hear it? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,But different. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Spooky if you ask me. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Come on Cameron, don't you get anything? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Me. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP, What? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I can't make it guys. I have to have dinner at the Danburry's house. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in their nineties or something. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Ooh! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Anything's better than Hell-ton hash. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I'll second that. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yeah we'll see. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Hey, you coming to the study group tonight? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I wanna do. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Suit yourself. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Ready to go sir. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"This is the Danburry's, right? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Mrs. Danburry? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yes. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Nice to meet you sir. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,He's great. He just did a big case for GM. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Of course. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,How was dinner? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Huh? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,How was dinner? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Terrible. Awful. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Why? What happened? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl in my entire life. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Are you crazy? What's wrong with that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,That guy could eat a football. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie, it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in love with such a jerk. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I can't just forget her Cameron. And I can't think about trig. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Did you see her naked? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Very funny Dalton. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Gentlemen, open your text to page twenty-one of the introduction. Mr. Perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface, entitled ""Understanding Poetry""? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. Then ask two questions: One, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective. Question one rates the poem's perfection, question two rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining a poem's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"If the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"A sonnet by Byron may score high on the vertical, but only average on the horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will understanding of poetry. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe, we're talking about poetry. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"I mean, how can you describe poetry like American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give him a 42, but I can't dance to it. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Now I want you to rip out that page. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Go on, rip out the entire page. You heard me, rip it out. Rip it out! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Go on, rip it out. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you what, don't just tear out that page, tear out the entire introduction. I want it gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr. Pritchard. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"We'll perforate it, put it on a roll. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"It's not the bible, you're not going to go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean tear, I want nothing left of it. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Rip, rip, rip! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,I don't hear enough rips. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Mr. McAllister. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,I am. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Keep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle, a war. And the casualties could be your hearts and souls. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics going forward, measuring poetry. No, we will not have that here. No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you will learn to think for yourselves again. You will learn to savor words and language. No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world. I see that look in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school. Right? Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking ""Yes, we should simply study our Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions."" I have a little secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman: ""O me, o life of the questions of these recurring, of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish. What good amid these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are here. That life exists, and identity. That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,What will your verse be? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"I'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,You think so? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"We're not talking artists George, we're talking free thinkers. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"But only in their dreams can man be truly free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus will be. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, Keating. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Hey, I found his senior annual in the library. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Listen to this, captain of the soccer team, editor of the school annual, Cambridge bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,What's the Dead Poets Society? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I don't know. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Nothing. No other mention of it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain, My Captain? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Gentlemen. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,We were just looking in your old annual. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley ""The Tool"" Wilson- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,God. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,What was the Dead Poets Society? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,I doubt the present administration would look too favorably upon that. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Why? What was it? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Gentlemen, can you keep a secret? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Sure. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life. That's a phrase from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the beginning of each meeting. You see we'd gather at the old Indian cave and take turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman, Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our own verse. And in the enchantment of the moment we'd let poetry work its magic. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just ""guys"", we weren't a Greek organization, we were romantics. We didn't just read poetry, we let it drip from our tongues like honey. Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that, especially my picture. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Dead Poets Society. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I say we go tonight. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Tonight? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,It's beyond the stream. I know where it is. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Don't go. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"So don't come, please. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"No shit, Sherlock. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"All right, who's in? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Forget Hager, no. Who's in? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I'm in. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,What? Pitts- 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Pitsie, come on. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You can help him Meeks. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, are your grades hurting too? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Except sex. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What about you Knox? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I don't know Charlie. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yeah? How? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Women swoon. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me why they swoon. Charlie! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ," Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall. It's right there. It's got to be on the banks. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Well, why don't you stay home? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Todd, are you coming tonight? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,No. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Why not? God, you were there. You heard Keating. Don't you want to do something about it? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Yes, but- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,But? But what? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Keating said that everybody took turns reading and I don't want to do that. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Gosh, you really have a problem with that, don't you? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just- I just don't want to do it, okay? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,All right. What if you didn't have to read? What if you just came and listened? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,That's not how it works. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Forget how it works. What if they said it was okay? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"What? What are you gonna do, go up and ask them? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"No. No, Neil. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I'll be right back. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Neil, Neil! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You're in. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Arrr, I'm a dead poet. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP," Guys, over here. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"God, are you trying to smoke us out of here? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You okay? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"All right, all right, forget the fire. Let's go gentlemen. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets Society. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Welton chapter. The meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present. Todd Anderson, because he prefers not to read, will keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now read the traditional opening message by society member Henry David Thoreau. ""I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I'll second that. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"""To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,And Keating's marked a bunch of other pages. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"All right, intermission. Dig deep right here. Right here, lay it down "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Don't keep anything back either. You guys are always bumming my smokes. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Raisins? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yuck. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Come on. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"It was a dark and rainy night, and this old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles, sat by herself in her house at her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle. But as she pieced the puzzle together, she realized, to her astonishment, that the image that was formed was her very own room. And the figure in the center of the puzzle, as she completed it, was herself. And with trembling hands, she placed the last four pieces and stared in horror at the face of a demented madman at the window. The last thing that this old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"This is true, this is true. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Ha! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,The thing with the hand- 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I told you that one. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"When were you in six, last year? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,You want to hear a real poem? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"All right? No, I don't need it. You take it. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You memorized a poem? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I didn't memorize a poem. Move up. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,An original piece. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You know this is history. Right? This is history. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP," Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more wit. I, chief professor, am of it. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"The god of love, if such a thing there be, may learn to love from me. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Wow! Did you write that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Alfred Lord Tennyson. Come my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset. And though we are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Meeks, Meeks. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"A man is not very tire, he is exhausted. And don't use very sad, use- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, KNOX Morose? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Exactly! Morose. Now, language was developed for one endeavor, and that is? Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or an amoeba? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Mr. Perry? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Uh, to communicate. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,No! To woo women. Today we're going to be talking about William Shakespeare. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"I know. A lot of you looked forward to this about as much as you look forward to root canal work. We're gonna talk about Shakespeare as someone who writes something very interesting. Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare done very much like this: "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"""Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy a good dog once in a while, sir. You can have yourself a three-course meal from one dog. Start with your canine crudites, go to your Fido flambe for main course and for dessert, a Pekingese parfait. And you can pick your teeth with a little paw."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Why do I stand up here? Anybody? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,To feel taller. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,No! Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I stand upon my desk to remind yourself that we must constantly look at things in a different way. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"You see, the world looks very different from up here. You don't believe me? Come see for yourself. Come on. Come on! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Just when you think you know something, you have to look at it in another way. Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try! Now, when you read, don't just consider what the author thinks. Consider what you think. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, ""Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."" Don't be resigned to that. Break out! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings. Look around you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"There! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find new ground. Now, in addition to your essays, I would like you to compose a poem of your own, an original work. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"That's right! You have to deliver it aloud in front of the class on Monday. Bonne chance, gentlemen. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't know that this assignment scares the hell out of you, you mole. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I found it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,You found what? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"What I wanna do right now. What's really, really inside me. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"""A Midsummer Night's Dream""? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,This is it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,What is this? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"It's a play, dummy. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have to do with you? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Right. They're putting it on at Henley Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Yes, so? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna be an actor! Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to try this. I even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't let me. For the first time in my whole life I know what I wanna do. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"First I gotta get the part, then I can worry about that. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didn't even tell him? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of this. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Well, that's impossible. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Well, why don't you just call him and ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,That's a laugh! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Yeah, but if he said-- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ," Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"I mean, I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a little while? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You're coming to the meeting this afternoon? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,I don't know. Maybe. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,W-What is that supposed to mean? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You're in the club! Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,So- You want me out? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"No! I want you in, but being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this concern, but I-I'm not like you. All right? You, you, you say thing and people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Don't you think you could be? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not the point. The, the, the point is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you can just butt out. I can take care of myself just fine. All right? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,No. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"What do you mean, ""no""? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,No. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"""We are dreaming of a--"" Poetry! I'm being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, okay. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Give it to me! Give it to me! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Charlie! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Now, devotees may argue that one sport or game is inherently better than another. For me, sport is actually a chance for us to have other human beings push us to excel. I want you all to come over here and take a slip of paper and line up single file. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. Mr. Pitts, rise above your name. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"I want you to hand these out to the boys, one apiece. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"You know what to do, Pitts. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it again like you're undaunted. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Now go on. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Yes! Next. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Next. Louder! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Yes! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill your soul! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"""To indeed be a god!"" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play Puck! I'm gonna play Puck! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,That's the main part. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Great, Neil. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Charlie, I got it! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. Good for you. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Neil, how are you gonna do this? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,They need a letter of permission from my father and Mr. Nolan. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,You're not gonna write it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Oh yes, I am. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Okay. ""I am writing to you on behalf of my son Neil Perry."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,This is great. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP," ""To Chris."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"I see a sweetness in her smile. Blight light shines from her eyes. But life is complete; contentment is mine, Just knowing that... "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,just knowing that she's alive. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good effort. It touched on one of the major themes, love. A major theme not only in poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing. You're up. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is the first poem to ever have a negative score on the Pritchard scale. We're not laughing at you, we're laughing near you. I don't mind that your poem had a simple theme. Sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about simple things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. You see, poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it. Just don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, who's next? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put you out of your misery. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Anderson thinks that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I think you're wrong. I think you have something inside of you that is worth a great deal. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"""I sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world."" W. W. Uncle Walt again. Now, for those of you who don't know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, Todd, I would like you to give us a demonstration of a barbaric ""yawp."" Come on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's go. Come on. Up. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"You gotta get in ""yawping"" stance. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,A yawp? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP, Yawp. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Come on, louder. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP, Yawp. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Yawp. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Oh, good God, boy. Yell like a man! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP, Yawp! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"There it is. You see, you have a barbarian in you, after all. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Now, you don't get away that easy. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,The picture of Uncle Walt up there. What does he remind you of? Don't think. Answer. Go on. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,A m-m-madman. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,What kind of madman? Don't think about it. Just answer again. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,A c-crazy madman. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, you can do better than that. Free up your mind. Use your imagination. Say the first thing that pops into your head, even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go on. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Good God, boy, there's a poet in you, after all. There, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what you see. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Uh, I-I close my eyes. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Yes? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Uh, and this image floats beside me. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,A sweaty-toothed madman? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Oh, that's excellent. Now, give him action. Make him do something. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,H-His hands reach out and choke me. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"And, and all the time he's mumbling. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,What's he mumbling? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"M-Mumbling, ""Truth. Truth is like, like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Forget them, forget them. Stay with the blanket. Tell me about that blanket. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP, Don't you forget this. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Really? Mine's got thirty. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Come on, Knox. Join in. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What's wrong? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,That's not funny. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ, Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Friend, scholar, Welton men. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,No. This is the god of the cave. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What do you say we start this meeting? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Gentlemen, ""Poetrusic"" by Charles Dalton. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. Gotta do more. Gotta be more. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta do more! Gotta be more! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,My parents made me take the clarinet for years. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone is more sonorous. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"I can't take it anymore. If I don't have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"No, Charlie. That's just my problem. I've been calm all my life. I'll do something about that. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Where are you going? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What are you gonna do? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I'm gonna call her. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will kill me. All right, goddamn it. You're right. ""Carpe diem."" Even if it kills me. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Hello, Chris? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,She's glad I called. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Would I like to come to a party? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Yes. Say, yes. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Well, sure. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. Thank you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna call me. She invited me to a party with her. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,At Chet Danburry's house. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yeah. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Well? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,So? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"So, you don't really think she means you're going with her? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's not the point. That's not the point at all. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What is the point? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"The point, Charlie, is, uh-- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Yeah? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"that she was thinking about me. I've only met her once, and already she's thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to be mine. Carpe. Carpe! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take a stroll. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,There it is. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"I don't know, but I've been told-- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Doing poetry is old-- 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left, left-right-left. Left, halt! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, everyone started off with their own stride, their own pace. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could see him thinking, ""Is this right? It might be right. It might be right. I know that. Maybe not. I don't know."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force. Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. I brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity: the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. Now, those of you -- I see the look in your eyes like, ""I would've walked differently."" Well, ask yourselves why you were clapping. Now, we all have a great need for acceptance. But you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go, ""That's baaaaad."" Robert Frost said, ""Two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."" Now, I want you to find your own walk right now. Your own way of striding, pacing. Any direction. Anything you want. Whether it's proud, whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,You don't have to perform. Just make it for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining us? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Exercising the right not to walk. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just illustrated the point. Swim against the stream. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Todd? Hey. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Hey. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,What's going on? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Nothing. Today's my birthday. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Thanks. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,What's you get? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,My parents gave me this. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Isn't this the same desk set- 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing as last year. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Oh. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Oh. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ, Maybe they thought you needed another one. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Maybe they weren't thinking about anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is about this is I, I didn't even like it the first time. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Todd, I think you're underestimating the value of this desk set. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"I mean, who would want a football or a baseball, or- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Or a car. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if I were ever going to buy a, a desk set twice, I would probably buy this one both times. In fact, its, its shape is, it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can feel it. This desk set wants to fly. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Todd? The world's first unmanned flying desk set. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Oh, my! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get another one next year. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. It's my cave. Watch your step. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and-- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Tina. This is the pledge class of the Dead Poets Society. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Hello. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's Friday night. Let's get on with the meeting. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Guys, I have an announcement to make. In keeping with the spirit of passionate experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From now on, call me Nuwanda. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Nuwanda? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Hello? Hello, Chris? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP, KNOX Hi. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,No. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,But I-- 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, guys. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,To Mutt. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I don't really know Mutt. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,To Mighty Mutt. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Will do. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,We gonna have a meeting or what? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Join? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I made that up just for you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"I'll write one for you too, Gloria. She walks in beauty like the night. She walks in beauty like the night. Of cloudless climes and starry skies. All that's best, dark and bright, Meet in her aspect and her eyes. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,There's plenty more where that came from. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,God help me. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Carpe diem. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but you've gotta- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce I published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP, So we can all stop beating off. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,How did you do that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Why? Nobody knows who we are. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"It's Nuwanda, Cameron. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Are we just playing around out here, or do we mean what we say? For all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each other. What the hell are we doing? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"All right, but you still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. This could mean trouble. You don't speak for the club. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Hey, would you not worry about your precious little neck? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just a moment. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's God. He says we should have girls at Welton. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You kicked out? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,No. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,So what happened? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP, KEATING Certainly. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Well, your reprimand made quite an impression, I'm sure. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Courtyard? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Oh, that. That was an exercise to prove a point. Dangers of conformity. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,I always thought the idea of educating was to learn to think for yourself. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Creak. He started walking around towards my left. Creak. Creak. ""Assume the position, Mr. Dalton."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"It's all right, gentlemen. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Mr. Keating. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Mr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone. Sure there's a time for daring and there's a time for caution, and a wise man understands which is called for. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,But I thought you'd like that. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No. You being expelled from school is not daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause you'll miss some golden opportunities. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Yeah. Like what? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes. Got it, Ace? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Aye, aye, Captain. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Keep your head about you. That goes for the lot of you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Phone call from God. If it had been collect, it wouldn't been daring. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,All right. Go on. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Save some for me. ""But, room, Fairy! Here comes Oberon."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Father. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ," NEIL Wait a minute. Before you say anything, please let me ex- "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP, NEIL No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. I've gotten all A's in every class. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"No, I can't. I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Yes, sir. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"No, sir. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,It's open. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Neil, what's up? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Can I speak to you a minute? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Certainly. Sit down. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I'm sorry. Here. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Excuse me. Get you some tea? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Tea. Sure. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Like some milk or sugar in that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"No, thanks. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Gosh, they don't give you much room around here. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, it's part of the monastic oath. They don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,She's pretty. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,She's also in London. Makes it a little difficult. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,How can you stand it? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Stand what? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,You can go anywhere. You can do anything. How can you stand being here? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be anywhere else. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,What's up? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"I just talked to my father. He's making me quit the play at Henley Hall. Acting's everything to me. I-- But he doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's, and we-- But he's planning the rest of my life for me, and I-- H-He's never asked me what I want. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Have you ever told your father what you just told me? About your passion for acting. You ever show him that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I can't. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Why not? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I can't talk to him this way. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Then you're acting for him, too. You're playing the part of the dutiful son. I know this sounds impossible, but you have to talk to him. You have to show him who you are, what your heart is. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"I know what he'll say. He'll tell me that acting's a whim, and I should forget it. That how they're counting on me. He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind, ""for my own good."" "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"You are not an indentured servant. If it's not a whim for you, you prove it to him by your conviction and your passion. You show him that And if he still doesn't believe you, well, by then you'll be out of school and you can do anything you want. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,No. What about the play? The show's tomorrow night. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Well, you have to talk to him before tomorrow night. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Isn't there an easier way? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,No. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I'm trapped. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"No, you're not. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Chris! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Thanks. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Excuse me. Chris. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I came to apologize for the other night. I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"I can't care. I love you, Chris. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. Please, accept these. Please. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,All I'm asking you to do is listen. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,The heavens made a girl named Chris With hair and skin of gold. To touch her would be paradise. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Get out of here. Cameron, you fool. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to her? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Yeah. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Nothing. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Nothing. But I did it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What did she say? I know she had to say something. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Seize the day! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Did you talk to your father? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at least he's letting me stay in the play. He won't be able to make, make it. He's in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Really? You told him what you told me? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone at least four days. I don't think he'll make the show, but I think he'll let me stay with it. ""Keep up the school work."" Thanks. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss Neil's entrance. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,W-What is that? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility. Makes me feel potent, like it can drive girls crazy. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are waiting. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Chris. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,What are you doing here? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Yeah, come on, guys. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they catch you, we're both gonna be in big trouble. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"I can't, Chris. I love you. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Are you going with him? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Then come with me. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come with me tonight. And then, if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,He won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,Dead Poets Honor. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,My word. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Hey, there he is! Hey, hey. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,"Shh, boys. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP, He's good. He's really good. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Yeah, Neil! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Neil, Neil, you were great. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"I can't, guys. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Neil! Neil!

DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,JOHNKEATING,ENFP,Don't make it any worse than it is. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Is it okay if we walk back? Captain? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Knox. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,"But that's ten more years. Father, that's a lifetime! "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I've got to tell you what I feel. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,Nothing. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ,I was good. I was really good. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ, Mr. Perry notices the open window. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,NEILPERRY,ENFJ, Mr. Perry notices the door to his study is ajar.

DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,What is it?

DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"It's all right, Todd. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,It's all right. It's alright. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,It was his father! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,No! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"He wouldn't have left us. It's because he- He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his father did it. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Todd. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,His father killed him. He made him do it. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP, CHARLIE Leave him be. 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,You told him about this meeting?

DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office right now, finking. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The board of directors, the trustees and Mr. Nolan. Do you think for one moment they're gonna let this thing just blow over? Schools go down because of things like this. They need a scapegoat. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,"You finked, didn't you, Cameron? "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,You told Nolan everything about the club is what I'm talking about.

DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and you're out. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,I'm out anyway! 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,KNOXOVERSTREET,ISFP,"You don't know that, not yet. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,What's that mean? Who are they after? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,CHARLIENUWANDADALTON,ENTP,Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is that what they're saying? 
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,"That is not true, Cameron. You know that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil loved acting. "
DEADPOETSSOCIETY,TODDANDERSON,INFP,Meeks?

CORALINE,CAT,ISTP, 
CORALINE,CAT,ISTP,You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so.

ONEFLEWOVERTHECUCKOOSNEST,RANDLEMCMURPHY,ESTP," Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying... "
ONEFLEWOVERTHECUCKOOSNEST,RANDLEMCMURPHY,ESTP," A beat, then Miller starts herding the patients toward the washroom, staying clear of McMurphy and Bromden, who don't move. "
ONEFLEWOVERTHECUCKOOSNEST,RANDLEMCMURPHY,ESTP, Let's go! 
ONEFLEWOVERTHECUCKOOSNEST,RANDLEMCMURPHY,ESTP," Let's go, Chief... "
ONEFLEWOVERTHECUCKOOSNEST,RANDLEMCMURPHY,ESTP," MILLER Hey, what's gone here? "
ONEFLEWOVERTHECUCKOOSNEST,RANDLEMCMURPHY,ESTP,"Billy, oh, Billy boy... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Rachel? What are you doing here? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Help me how? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I think I'm gonna be sick. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, More. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Does Mom know you're here? It's gotta be past 10. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I thought it was a great day. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," Um...you know what...let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Just like that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You're not? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,That is such a lie! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, What do you know about PMS? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh my god. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, So I'm Nancy?! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, I'm gonna throw up. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm in love with Summer. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What do we know about this new girl? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Really? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Maybe she was just in a hurry. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Damn. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sorry? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, You like the Smiths? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Oh my god. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hi. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"So, uh, Summer... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, TOM Yeah! How's it going so far? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Both... Either. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Oh, you know, 4, 5... years. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Are you nuts? I don't even want to do it now. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I studied to be an architect actually. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved to the city to work for a company. Company went under. Needed a job. My friend worked here. Got me this. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Well I wrote that one. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's a big seller. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh... No. I doubt it. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Why thank you. That's what they called me in college. ""Perfectly adequate"" Hansen. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Ok, well, I'll see you around. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Of course it does. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey Martin. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What's this? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Ok... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What does this have to do with--? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,But Amanda... this is a great fucking song! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's off. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Me and Summer. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. But it could have been. In a world where good things happen to me. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You ready for this? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Summer... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, So how was your weekend? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You believe that shit? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"""It was good."" She didn't say ""It was good."" She said ""It was good."" Emphasis on the good. She basically said ""I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym."" Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,And some other things. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I gave her all sorts of chances. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I think you know what I need. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Toner. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Do you want to go out with me? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"And the Priest says, ""But we're already out!"" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I know! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No way McKenzie. Absolutely not. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,They won't let you back in there after last time. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,We are not going back there. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hi. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You asked if I was coming? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"You were great up there, by the way. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, I hear that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Lived there til I was 12. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No kidding? What's his name? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, That makes sense. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,But...what if you meet someone and fall in love? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Of course I do. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Well mine too but -- 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Well... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I think it's...kind of a huge thing. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Nooo. I don't sing in public. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,That's not it. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I have no idea. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,This is gonna bother me for weeks. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh here we go. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Ok, let's get you in a cab. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,He'll be fine. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What's up? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," Ok, goodnight McKenzie! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't -- 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. I like you. Of course I do. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Right. As a friend. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Cool. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,G'night Summer. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey Mr. Vance. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Shhh. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I have not been... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Paul, seriously... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Shhh! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,If you heard... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Excellent. You ready to go. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, He exaggerates! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Check them out. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, That is hot. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I am very turned on right now. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Huh? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"9, 9.5? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I hear ya. If I want to watch people make out, I have big windows and binoculars at home. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, No. That would be wrong. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Thanks. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Sure. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Not me. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sure. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'll be...back in a sec. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Are you calm? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh sweet Jesus! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, I fucking hate Summer. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's very... complex. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I feel the same way. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You wanna go to the movies? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It just makes you feel... peaceful. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"No. See now, this is torture. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"There's a million things. First, there's no need for this much glass. You could easily... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No you go first. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Whatever you want. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hello? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ow! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,There's no way. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"""Octopus's Garden?"" You may as well just say ""Piggies?"" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You're insane. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Cause nobody loves Ringo. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I wouldn't say that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Like, are we ""going steady?"" Come on, guys. We're adults. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It is when you've been with the same girl since high school. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Something like that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No! She's not... We're not like that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,We've just been... hanging out. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. ""Boyfriend, girlfriend."" That stuff is very... juvenile. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know... Maybe. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. We're adults. It'll be fine. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Maybe. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"My thinking is... why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl ""I love you."" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Who the hell's Sean? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Something like that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Who's Lars? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,That son of a bitch. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Coach, no, wait! I need her. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hi. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Summer, I've gotta ask you something. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Do you? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I like how you dress. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Please don't. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Hi. I'm Tom. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey buddy -- 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey. What is it? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Come on, that guy was an asshole! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know. He was -- 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Whoa. What was that? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What...? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, I just got my ass kicked! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, I got one good shot in. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Hi. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What's up? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Wait, are you still mad at me? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, TOM Holy shit you are. I can't believe you! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. I'm all done. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You know what... Sometimes you really don't make any sense. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Huh? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need - 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Have you ever had a real ""boyfriend?"" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"A boyfriend. ""Going steady."" Whatever. You know what I mean. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,More than one? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Tell me about them. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Why? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Come on, I'm interested. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yes. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Quarterback slash homecoming king? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What happened to Markus? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok. And then? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,The Puma? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,And that's it? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What happened? Why didn't they work out? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Since grade school. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Great. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sorry. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Uh-huh. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No thanks. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm sorry. It's just... there's this girl. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before... Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, How was your weekend? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Actually she was never my girlfriend. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sure. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Oh! You know what we should do... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"""You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"""You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me,"" I'm talking about you Summer! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hello me. You having a good day? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? Why? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Well... You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've gotta eat right? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Sorta. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you want to do. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sure. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Good night. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Nope. All done. What are you working on? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Why don't you try... ""Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card."" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No worries. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"This is good Millie. ""To my wife, the love of my life. I love you."" That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... ""Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete."" You know, spice it up a little. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Did you try... ""Merry?"" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What else you got? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"""...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!"" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. It's pretty cool. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You really want to see this? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"It's, like, all stabbing and shit. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Fantastic. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh shit. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Hi Mom. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Mom, Martin, this is Summer. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if ""girlfriend"" is the right word... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sorry about that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What?! No way... I never used that word. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,He's very...loving. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You're having enough for both of us. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm not pissed. Summer... you know I hate this shit. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, That's real nice. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What do you mean? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Who? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Your...? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm not following. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Mr. Vance... are you firing me? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Funerals and sympathy? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What's going on? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Do I want to hear it? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months. I've been crazy. But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,There's no fucking way! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, TOM It can't be. It's impossible! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,How do you know? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Jesus Christ people! Get a room! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Nothing. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? Oh yeah. Great. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Twinkies? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm out of twinkies. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Go... where? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Hmm? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Uh...no. I really don't. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You know what...? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Can I say something about the cat? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," TOM ""Don't give up?"" ""You can do it?"" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this... (picks a card off the TABLE) ""I'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed."" What the hell? Let's give em some truth. Something like, ""Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here's a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead."" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Think about it. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. ""Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you."" Oh that's nice. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," TOM If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the boardroom table. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible! Everyone shifts in their seats. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... ""galoogoo."" "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,There's no fucking way! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, TOM It can't be. It's impossible! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,How do you know? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,But... It's May! We broke up last August. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,And you said she was single at Christmas. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,And now she's... 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Now she's getting married. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Married? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Fuck! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, PAUL Let him go. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I can't believe it either! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,The right girl I guess. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Oh you'd be surprised. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,July. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,No. Where's that coming from? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Well...glad you came? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Pretty big, yeah. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You having fun? You were great this morning. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Me? I'm good. I'm great. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yup. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Is that right? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,That's nice. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Those are guppies. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Are you making fun of me now? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's the new me. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Alright... go play with your friends. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Sure. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, TOM Hmm? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Are you still sleeping? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,10:30. Are we still hanging out today? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,So how was last night? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Where did you guys go? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Fun? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Pretty standard. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's playing at 5. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or --- 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok cool. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"No, I will. That's fine. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Hey. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Hey Sum, it's just a movie. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Is everything alright with you? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"It's ok. This happens to me every time I watch ""Hoosiers."" Let's go for a walk, ok. Let's get some air. Or go to Sister Ray's. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,And it's painful. Oh look. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,So... Now what? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some dinner or something? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Are you hungry? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ooh! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I've got a great idea! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Let's get breakfast. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Pancakes? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,So... I should probably say congratulations. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I don't know if I do honestly. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, God no. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I'm good. Ish. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah I quit the office. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,So who's the guy? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP," TOM No really, I don't. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,It's amazing to me. You're married. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, I'll never understand that. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, TOM What's different now? How could things change so quickly? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What happened?! That's what I don't get. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"What, tell me... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God! "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What? This is funny? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What are you laughing at? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,(trying himself not to LAUGH) You're a crazy person! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What are you talking about?! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,This is funny to you? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Summer! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I really do hope you're happy. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Sorry? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Oh. Yeah. Why, are you? "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ah. My competition. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Gee, this is a little awkward. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Well, I hope you don't get it. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"So, uh... "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Are you from...California? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I know Atherton. Nice area. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"I, uh, don't know. I don't think so. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yes! Exactly. I totally agree! 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see you. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yes. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Thank you. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Excuse me. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,When this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP, Oh. Got it... No problem. 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,What's that? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Yeah? 
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,"Great! So... I'll wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something. "
DAYSOFSUMMER,TOMHANSEN,INFP,Ok! 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,This is John. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,...it had to be you... 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, JOHN Yes? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Oh.   Sorry. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Well played, Norma. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," I'm up, I'm up. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"It ain't for sale, kid. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Maybe so... but I don't. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Do you need to go out? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,...Moose... 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Hello, Aurelio. 20. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Where is it? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thank you. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,...they killed my dog. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," Aren't ""they"" always... "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Where can I find Iosef Tarasov? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Evenin', Ed. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,No...just sorting out a few things with the Russian mob. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Thanks, Ed... but you still owe me. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Good night, Ed. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Yeah, that was me. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"This is Wick. John Wick, that's right. Yeah, it has been awhile. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"You, too, Charlie. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,I got me a hobby or two. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Sorry, Charlie, but no.     I'm on my own nowadays. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, JOHN 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,I make no promises on that. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"See ya', Charlie. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Consider it done. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,I called ahead.     Reservation for John Wick. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Depending on business, it may be more. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," Y'know, I haven't been here in years. When did the old girl get a facelift? "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Same owner? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Is she still singin'? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,That's good to hear. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"No, thanks. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," Can you send me up a hamburger - rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and fries? 44. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll leave that to your discretion. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thank you. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Guest. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,A table. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Yes, thank you. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Single Malt. Irish, if you've got it. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Perfect. Do you have a meat and cheese plate? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,No.   Thank you. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, My name is John Wick. You took my car. You killed my dog. Where... is Iosef? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,And where is Viggo? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Where... is... Viggo? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Please close out my tab. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Good evening. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"As for the car, I got that back, but as for Moose, well... I'm takin' a page from Exodus on that one: an eye for an eye. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Make your peace with God, Iosef... "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Evenin'.    Is the doctor in? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Send him up, please. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Depends.    How good's your laundry? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"No, I thought not. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Anything cold. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Did she chip off? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Good to hear. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,What sort of movement am I lookin' at? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,And after? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Thanks, doc. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Evenin'. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Maybe not... but I know this place. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,No.   Wait... 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,John Wick. 58. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,How about you? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,You gotta' name? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," Pleased to meet you, Eddie. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Please... call me, John. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Hello, Winston. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"That, it has. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Hey, Jimmy. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"I'm no good with time, but... it's been awhile. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"She got the card, the flowers... she knows you -all of you- loved her. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,I'd love a martini. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Good man. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Thanks, Jimmy. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Hey, Jenny. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"I'm not quite sure, but with that said... here I am. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,I know. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," No, no, Jenny... go right ahead. In fact... please do. I'd like to hear it, too. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"No, ma'am. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, I hear. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Do you know where Iosef is? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Do you know where Viggo is? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Do you know anythin' worth knowin'? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,What about it? 67. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, That'll do. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,I'm thinkin' so. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Hey, Harry. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," Night, Harry. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,You keen on earnin' a coin? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Do you mind babysittin' the breathin' one for, I dunno... "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Catch and release. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Good night, Harry. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,You don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be going to bed soon. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Yes, in fact. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Perfect. Oh, and... "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"You willin' to put a bullet in my back, Marcus? "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Been awhile, Marcus. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Why'd you take the job then? 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," Much appreciated, then. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP," What am I doing, Marcus? I mean... it is just a... was a... dog, but... "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, This isn't like me. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Good night, Marcus. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Yeah, that's about right. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,No. 73. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"We tried, but... wasn't in the cards. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, I figured as much. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Imagine what one would do if they did. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Goodbye, Viggo. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, SHUT... THE FUCK... UP! 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Americano, please.    And a bear claw. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Oh, and the bathroom? "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Thanks. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,EVERYBODY OUT! 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Take me to Viggo's stash. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,His stash. Personal Holdings. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Open it. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,Open it. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,So will I. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,That'll do. Thank you. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, No cops. That's new. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Yeah.    Yeah, we're good. Thanks. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Unless I complete the call, then... yes. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,No.   I didn't. 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP, Through and through... through and through... 
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Miko, huh? 99. "
JOHNWICK,JOHNWICK,ISTP,"Good girl, Miko... good girl. "

BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ, ALFRED Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE?? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Oh, yeah.  Watch this. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What does it look like? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,We can do better than that. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Yeah...the holidays, I guess.  Always gets me thinking about... "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Yeah.  I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,-- Yeah. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,-- Yeah.  I guess I'll pass on dessert. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Sure.  Comes off the top of my taxes -- 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ," BRUCE -- What I ""do"" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Randall.  You remember Vicki.  -- How's the construction business? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I'll think about it. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I've known him since he was seven years old.  He was a pig then too. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"What, tie him up with a bat-rope? "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Nice outfit. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Evasive. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,My illustrious great-grandfather.  Think it's the same kid we heard about? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,-- You work for this rag? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I need a good PR man. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Hey, it wasn't me, remember?  I am rich and powerful -- "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Quiet.  I'm looking for a personal ad. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"It's her.  That cat woman, or whatever she is. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,She's trying to contact me.  Says she's gonna leave me another ad... 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Cancel. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ," We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Well, Alfred, it's official.  I'm a wanted man. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ," A spooky development.  Does GORDON suspect?  After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I saw them occasionally.  We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,No.  I never liked the way they did business. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Then Batman is behind all this. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Well.  He's changed tactics, hasn't he. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Changed my mind, Alfred.  I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I just had a weird sense of deja vu. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Good to see you two.  Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Not at all.  Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us.  Can you? "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I can't imagine why. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,They're proccupied.  This string of murders -- 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I think we've already met.  -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Sorry to disappoint you. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ, No.  Come on.  What? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Oh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple.  Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Pull in the claws, okay?  She's really terrific. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Wait.  Let me explain about Vicki -- 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Relax, okay?  I like you better. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What have we got here? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,You're in a gruesome line of work. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"This one I know.  It's a gryphon, right? "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Poor guy.  Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What was it you wanted to talk to me about? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ, No. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What are you attracted to? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,How? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Is there a cat in here? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Who are you? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Great.  What'd you tell him? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Jesus, Alfred -- !! "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,It's just a few bruises. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I'm getting too old for this line of work. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,-- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ, BRUCE Selina.  What are you doing here? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,You heard about Harry Provost. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Same here. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Not bad.  Sarawak warrior caste. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ, London...Cairo...Belgium... 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Her credit card records. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Could be.  Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"That's what the Catwoman took from Provost.  A little raven statuette, about so big... "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"What, Alfred? "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What happened to it? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Wait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What are you looking for -- Batarangs? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I brought you a Christmas present.  Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I think you may have something that belonged to my father. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What are you talking about?  Who? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,It's time you told me what's going on here. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Whose fortune? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,The Five Families. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,-- that they were the ones behind the robbery? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,So they stole his piece of the puzzle. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,That doesn't matter.  If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Get your cap.  You're driving. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"According to this, he's directly below us. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Yeah.  Take a right. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,He's slowed down.  Looks like he's under the park. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I know another way in. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I can make you. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"I don't know, Alfred.  I've got other stuff to worry about. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,He hasn't got any parents. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,...I know. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Christmas eve.  No tree? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I'm surprised you kept this date.  I thought you would've lost interest by now. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"You've got what you want, don't you? "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,How much is it going to cost me? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,...To get the ravens back. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,What di-- what did you d-- 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Library -- got to get me to the library -- 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Alfred... 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I can't...get down there...without you. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,-- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal.  You know what to do. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Miss me, ""Angel""? "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,It's over.  I don't want to hurt you any more. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Nine lives. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,No. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,There's a radio in the cave.  We'll send for help. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,VICKI! 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"He saved all our lives, Jim.  I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,"Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin.  He's in town for the holidays. "
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ, VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,I dunno.  Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,Yeah.  Maybe you should -- open your present. 
BATMAN,BRUCEWAYNEBATMAN,INTJ,...You might as well. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm not playing your little games. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"We have done many things. We ride the bus. We have meaningful conversations about how yearbook club went and about her friends and, um...you know...drama. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, Knives Chau. She's Chinese. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I believe I mentioned the bus? Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story: 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yes. It is. Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's for me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You promise to be good? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, really. Please be good. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"She'll just sit in the corner, man. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,She'll geek. She geeks. She has the capacity to geek. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat. Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Knives, that's Young Neil. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Let's start with Launchpad McQuack. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeaaah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeaaah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeaaah...wait, what? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hurt, Kim. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Neil, you were saying she seems awesome. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeaaaah... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Ha, ha, ha, ha. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I mean. Don't tell my sister. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Who are you texting? RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's not true. Who told you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That gossipy bitch. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wallace! Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Her name is Knives. Knives Chau. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's a Catholic school too. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, the whole deal. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I don't know...it's just nice, you know? It's just...simple. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,This school has boys too. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating, more like... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That doesn't sound so good either. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey Knives, this is my cool gay roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Wallace, you go now! Begone! Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Did you know the original name of Pac- man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever? Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah. Wow. The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8... Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I thought Derek and Tamara had a mutual like-each-other thing going, what happened? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. Thank you, Knives. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, we're already pretty big. But it might be cool if cool people wore our T-shirt. Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs: "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Thank you, Julie. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Thank you, Julie. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I hearted them too until they signed to a major label and the singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life. But that's just me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Sorry, you were saying about me? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You go out with a lot of guys? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, so whatever, man! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Me neither. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,My secret lair is one of those 'no girls allowed' deals. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But do you want to see the house where I grew up? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Here you go. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh God...so...so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh God... Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I had this totally weird dream. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But there was this girl... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Libraries remind me of grade school. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 19 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It was...uh...my hand slipped. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,My girlfriend? A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Sorry, what are we doing? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Party? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ugh. I thought you guys split. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Aw, man. This is going to suck. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Awww maaan... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,...this sucks. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm going to go pee due to boredom. Scott exits frame. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Hey Comeau. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,This is Coke Zero. I don't drink. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Do you know this one girl with hair like this? Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, WHAT? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, what's up? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Nothing. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, you know Pacman? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I know of him. Scott begins to babble. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well you know Pac-Man was originally Puckman but not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the ""P"" and turn it into an ""F'�? You know? Like... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah that's amazing. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Um...am I dreaming? Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, DUDE! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, SHE'S TOTALLY REAL! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,DUDE. What do you know about Ramona Flowers?! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,LADYDUDES! What do you know about Ramona Flowers? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. What else? JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know her? Tell me. Now. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Does she really? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Did she reeally? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Did they reeeally? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl, she just- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I thought you guys broke up. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's garbage! Completely untrue. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Misunderstanding. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Not what it looked like! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, me and Kim are all good now. SCOTT looks to KIM. We hear the sound of arctic winds. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I guess Wallace. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So, that girl. From my dream. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I saw her at the library... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So then I'm at this party, and hey! There she is. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I think she's... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I think she's the girl of my dreams. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I've never been so sure about something. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What's that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I'm not getting it, friend. Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Not even! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wait. Who told you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,He's not even conscious! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Don't you have a job to do? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Wallace, how do you do that? HARD CUT to MORNING LIGHT filling the room! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Awesome! I have to order something reeeally cool. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Dude! This thing claims I have mail! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Dude! Now I'm reading it! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"""Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. My name is Matthew Patel, and I'm"" blah blah '�fair warning'� blah blah...hmm. This is...this is...THIS IS...!!! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,This is boring. Delete! '�CLICK.'� Scott walks to the front door. Moments pass. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Maybe. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You were saying? Scott opens the door. It's KNIVES CHAU! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Heyyy... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Attack hug. That's cute. He plasters on his best fake smile. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,How could I possibly forget? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's sucky. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Uh huh. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I tell ya'. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I can never get past that guy. Scott has his little videogame head cut off. The '�CONTINUE?'� countdown comes up...10...9...8... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Um, I think...I think... Scott takes a deep breath. This is never easy. 3...2...1... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? Who? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Sure. Great. We follow Scott as he walks in a daze to the bathroom. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hi, um, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Um, no, that's okay. You just have to sign for this alright? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I just woke up, and you were in my dream. I dreamt you were delivering me this package. Is that weird? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's not weird at all. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's not? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"No, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that I like to use. It's like three miles in fifteen seconds. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Right... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You don't remember me do you? I met you at the party the other day. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Were you the Pac-Man guy? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy. You're Ramona Flowers right? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,That's me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So, you're like American? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Why, am I coming off as rude? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Not at all. Noooooo... Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You know...you need to sign for this. Whatever this is? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's something really cool. You'd be impressed. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You still have to sign. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"But if I sign for it, you'll leave. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah. That's how it works. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever. I mean...there are reasons for you to hang out with me? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You're all over the place. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You are like...my dream girl. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I need to find a new route. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Either that or you need to start hanging out with me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You want me to hang out with you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Um...you know...if that's cool. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package? Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the package straight in the trash. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Why are you just standing there? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Dude, I'm totally waiting on you. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be on time. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Well. You assumed wrong. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So what do you want to do? We could get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip through some records at Sonic Boom. Oh, or there's this awesome game called Ninja Ninja Revolution at- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I'm not into simulated violence. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm cool with whatever you want to do. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,This is good. Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,This is good. So how'd you end up in Toronto? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Just needed to escape I guess. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh yeah? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I got this job here. And Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities so... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,He's...a friend. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Was he your boyfriend? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Do you mind if we don't get into that right now? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's so not interesting to me. They sit on some swings in the park. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,So what about you? What do you do? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm between jobs. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Between what and what? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,My last job is a long story filled with sighs. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I know plenty of those. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Is that why you left New York? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Pretty much. It was time to head somewhere a little more chilled. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, it's certainly chilled here. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah. Uh. Chilled as in cold. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm totally obsessed with you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I didn't mean to get you obsessed. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time. It's weird. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,That's probably because you sleep with a guy. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Um... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's... we're just poor! We can't afford two beds! We're not gay! Actually... no... Wallace is pretty gay. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Dude, relax. I believe you. You're too desperate to be gay. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I feel so stupid. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Aw... you're probably not that stupid. Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Well, you're definitely stupid if you want to go out with me. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Exactly, yeah. The snowfall gets heavier. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I think 'act of God' is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So this is a 'date', eh? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Tongue... The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Anyway, night's not over yet. I think there's a thingy up here somewhere. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,A thingy? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,A door. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,A door? I... I... I can't see you. I'm blind. Help me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What kind of tea do you want? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,There's more than one kind? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, constant comment and earl grey. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Did you make some of those up? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I think I'll have sleepytime. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That sounds good to me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Let me get you a blanket. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"That would actually be awesome. Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs. He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Dude! I'm changing. Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes BLACK. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I guess... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Maybe...maybe we should both get under it...since we're so cold. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Well...what about our tea? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I can...not have tea. The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off, revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I changed my mind. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Changed it to what? From what? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I don't want to have sex with you, Pilgrim. Not right now. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ohh...kay. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's not like I'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything. You can sleep in my bed. And I reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later. Ramona curls up next to Scott. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"This is cool, just this. It's been like a really long time, and this is...I think I needed this. Whatever this is. So, thanks. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You're welcome. They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to - 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I have to work. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Work? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You have to leave. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, can this not be a one night stand? For one thing, I didn't even get any...that was a joke. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What did you have in mind? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Umm...oh, come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, we're terrible. Please come. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Sure. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Wait! Can I get your number? SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott. She hands him a note. '�RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'� "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Wow, girl number. Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh, hey! It's tonight...At The- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You totally came! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Yes. I did totally come. Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Hey. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, HEYYYYYYYY! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I...uh... LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters. People love us. Right? Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,He's...um. He's a friend. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,We gotta play now and loud! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Is that seriously the end of the story? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What did I do? Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What do I do?! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Thank you, Wallace! Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Who the hell are you anyway? The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You're what? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Anyone need another drink? Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks. Scott blocks. Patel punches. Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,We're fighting because of Ramona? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I skimmed it. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Are you a pirate? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You really went out with this guy? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Yeah, in the seventh grade. The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Dude, wait...mystical powers? Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"That doesn't even rhyme. Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Sweet. Coins. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Well, it was great meeting you. Tell your gay friends I said bye. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Aw man. $2.40? That's not even enough for the bus home. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I'll lend you the 30 cents. Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Sooooooo... A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What was all that all about? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Uh, I guess... Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You have seven evil ex-boyfriends? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Seven ex's, yes. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So I have to fight- 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Defeat. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,-defeat your seven evil ex's if we're going to continue to date. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Pretty much. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So, what you're saying is... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Uh, I guess. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Cool. Do you want to make out? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Uh... Scott kisses Ramona. The studio audience 'awwww's. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, someone got to second base last night. And someone has a second date tonight. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You know when I say '�someone', I mean me, right? I got to second base last night...maybe first and a half. Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,One of your famous ultimatums? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But...but...it's HARD. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But you...you're... At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and helps himself to coffee. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You're a monster. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Who's Lucas Lee? Wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of NOW magazine. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,They make movies in Toronto? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So, this Lucas Lee- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You suck. Surprising no one. Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ummm... Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's not dorky! Why are you psychic? A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, listen- The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Like, Chinese food? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Hmm. It's not my favorite. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Uh...I think that's a really bad idea. Like, really, just so bad. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well I mean, I'm too old for you! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,And...and...are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Um, listen...I was thinking we should break up or whatever. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah...um...it's not going to work out. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh. No. We broke up. Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Aw, thanks. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Aw, thanks. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll meet my new new girlfriend soon. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Okay! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool? Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know your hair? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I know of it. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's all blue. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah. I just dyed it. Are you going to introduce me? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills, Young Neil, that's... Kim. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Hey everyone. Everyone mumbles back. Scott still stares at Ramona's hair. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Is it weird not being pink anymore? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I change my hair every week and a half, dude. Get used to it. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Got any embarassing stories? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Neil knows my parts. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, good. Good. Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,She changed her hair. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I know, but she changed it without even making a big deal about it. She's spontaneous. Impulsive. Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,How's dinner coming along? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, good. Good. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Don't go. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You think so? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,'�If I strike out'�? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,This is actually really good garlic bread. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just all the time without even stopping. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You'd get fat. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No. Why would I get fat? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Bread makes you fat. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Bread makes you FAT?? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So I wrote a song about you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Oh yeah? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I can't wait to hear it when it's finished. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Finished? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Your hair's pretty shaggy. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!? Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I got... I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. But it's so long ago, I can barely remember it... A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Sounds like a bad time. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Not really. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It was a mutual thing. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I mean, she told me it was mutual. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What was her name? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,She was Nat when I knew her. But she stopped liking that name. Then...she stopped liking me... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Your hair is cute. I like it long. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?! Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What? Why are you wearing that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I thought we could go for a walk. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Nooo. I just love me some walking. Putting one leg in front of the other. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You seem a little...heightened. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What is this place? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"A totally awesome castle. They're shooting this movie up here. Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Who's in it? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Winifred Hailey and some actor guy. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Oh, who? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I forget. Let's find out. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Did you find the guy you're stalking? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Mr. Lee? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Ooh. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Ooh? The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits his trailer, smoking a cigarette . He skates towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go '�oooh'�. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Oh, man. We gotta go. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? Why? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I used to date that clown. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Wallace. I am not a slut. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh...my...God... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,...you dated a FAMOUS guy?! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually, it might have been math. I just remember there being lots of drama. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,He just followed me around. He was a little snot nosed brat. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,He had snot? In his nose? But he's famous! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half- 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,He's famous and he talked to me! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Can I get- POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back up with a pen and paper, wobbly. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Can I get your autograph? POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done- Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"How does it feel to- KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You're needed back on set. Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP! Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline. Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,The League of Evil Axes? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ummm... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,...no. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Really? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You are a pretty good actor. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But are you a pretty good skater? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail? Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So can you do a grind thingy now? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, if it's too hardcore... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,There's girls watching. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wow. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wow. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yes! Fist bump. Scott smacks his forehead. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I didn't get his autograph. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Where's Ramona? Is she still here? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What's the deal? Seriously. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me back. Scott Pilgrim. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know what really sucks though? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Everything! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Kisses? Seven little kisses? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Why does everything have to be so complicated? Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Lesbian? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Lesbians? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? Why? Are you moving in with Other Scott or Jimmy or someone? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,...Envy? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Approximately. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm not doing so good right now. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"What? No, stop. I've been-it's been different. You have no idea. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yes, you should. I have this totally awesome girlfriend who calls me all the time. And she's America. Uh. She's American. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm not telling you that. Ramona. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? Do you know her? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It sounded like you did. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, WAIT- CLICK...Scott slumps to the floor. Wallace appears over him. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Dude. WHOOSH 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Please. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm really not in the mood. SHWAA 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Okay, enough! Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Listen, I've had it today. Can we not do this right now? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What's that from? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well whatever this is about, can it wait till I'm in the right frame of mind? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Wait, am I asleep right now? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So, technically this is not a nightmare. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, I'm really, really not up for this. Whatever it is. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh man. Someone help me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,It's Scott. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, it's Scott. It's actually me. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I didn't do anything. It's everyone else that's crazy. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Cool, I'm coming in. Scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Think I'll make it a decaf today. Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Is there anywhere you don't work? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,How do you do that with your mouth? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Uh. Can I get a caramel macchiato? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Me? Wreak havoc? Julie points at THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD poster behind the counter with concert dates at the bottom. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So I can pick up my coffee over here? Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into... RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Sorry that got a little crazy last night. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. You kind of disappeared. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know it's hard to be around me sometimes. I'll understand if you don't want to hang anymore. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No. No, I want to hang. The whole evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Exes. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I mean, I know it's early days, but I don't think anything can really get in the way of how I SHIT! Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop...the singer from THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD has seemingly stepped out of the poster. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,The big one? Scott nods. LEONE STAREDOWN between Envy and Ramona. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I'm gonna...excuse me. Ramona goes to order coffee, leaving Envy to fix on Scott. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,YOU'RE jealous? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You left me! For that cocky pretty boy! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. I know. You left me for a guy I've never even seen. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's so not going to happen. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,So...that was Nat? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, that was Envy. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,So...what did you guys talk about? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,She's totally jealous of you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Envy's jealous? How about that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. How. About. That. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What happened with the two of you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Do you mind if we don't get into that right now? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"And two weeks later, you heard they were sleeping together I guess? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Basically. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I dated a Todd once. That didn't end well either. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I can see how it sucks. Having the past come back to haunt you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Is it wrong that I try not to think about it? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What do you want to think about? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,How warm my place is right now. Ramona stops and kisses him. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend. A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Double negative. Tricky. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Right. I'm not gonna let her toy with me. From this moment on, I will think of Envy Adams no more! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I hate you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Can't we do our own secret shows? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What would you do? If your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,If my ex was in the band? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It might be a little awkward. But maybe it's the grown up thing to do. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, we're all adults right? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I don't know. Did you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Hey. Ramona exits, confused. Knives follows. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What the hell? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What the hell? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Who is that girl again? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Briefly. Briefly. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"How old is she? A '�WHEEL OF FORTUNE'� spins INSIDE SCOTT'S HEAD, with selections such as '�It was nothing'� and '�She was nobody.'� The wheel sticks between '�I gotta pee.'� and '�Who, her?'� "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I gotta pee on her. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That guy on bass? That's Todd. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I know. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh no. Envy lets her coat slip off, revealing a stunning figure. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I think I'm going to throw up. Julie opens the backstage door and huffs. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,All of us? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Hey Todd. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Mmm hmm. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP, I think we should get out of here. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What of it? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Knives!? Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid. Scott boils. Todd smirks. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"That is IT, you cocky cock! YOU'LL PAY "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,KK...my neck...yy...your hair... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No kidding...anyone can be...vegan. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ovo what? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"If I peed my pants, would you pretend I just got wet from the rain? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's not raining. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh. How about you give me the Cliff Notes on how and why you ended up dating this a-hole? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Is that really important right now? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"If there's a key element in his backstory that can help me out in a critical moment of not dying? Yes. A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Have you dumped everyone you've ever been with? You've never been the dumpee? Ramona shrugs. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Look, I've dabbled with being a bitch. It's part of the reason I moved here. I was really hoping to put it all behind me. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,He and me. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I...dislike you. Capiche? Understand? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Um... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Sorry, so what's on Monday? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You used to be so...nice! Scott CHARGES at Todd, who PSYCH-THROWS him back into the club. We hear a distant CRUMP. Stills calls through the hole. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"The reverb is hurting my soul!!! Scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall. Todd LEVITATES, fauxhawk rising. He hovers next to him. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What say we drink to my memory? Fair trade blend with soymilk? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Actually, I poured soy in this cup, but thought real hard about pouring it in that one. You know, in my mind's eye or whatever. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You just drank Half & Half. TWO TRENDY POLICE TYPES BUST IN THROUGH THE WALL, making two more holes and pointing their fingers like deadly weapons. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You once were a vegone, but now you will be gone! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Uh, sorry I guess. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You kicked my heart in the ass. So I guess we're even. Natalie. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Maybe they should. Now let's get out of here. A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall. Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Crummy way to end things, I know. Envy blinks, in shock. Julie pops into shot. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Are you okay? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Uh huh. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You sure about that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Do I look like I'm not okay? Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Do you want to go? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I kind of almost died back there, so... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I'm not saying I want to go. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, we can totally go. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I'll do whatever you want to do. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So let's go. Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,We really don't have to go to this thing. It'll probably be a bad scene all around and we've already had a full night. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's just...? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything...but have you ever dated someone who wasn't a total ass? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,So far you're not a total ass. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But I'm part ass? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"If it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy I've dated. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wait...is that good? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's what I need right now. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But not...later? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Scott, I don't have all the answers. I'd just like to live in the moment if I can. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, I'd just like to live. Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But are you saying Envy wasn't? We all have baggage. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,My baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes. What did you do to your ex-boyfriends to make them so insane? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Exes. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, WHATEVER- 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,No break up is painless. Someone always gets hurt. What about you and that girl Knives? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Knives? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Who broke up with who? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I believe...I broke up with her. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,And was she cool with that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Knives is with Young Neil now, she's totally cool with it. They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You sure about that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah. She's very mature for her age. It was a very healthy break up. We're all peaches and gravy. We hear an offscreen distant '�nooooo' from Knives. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,And what about you and Kim? They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Me and Kim? I can barely remember. Why, is it important? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Hey, you want to know everything about my past, dude. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"It was just...yeah. I don't know. It was high school. She had freckles. It was cool, I guess. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,That's it? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,That's really the whole story? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get with her! I fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude! And I had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too! He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes! He was totally awesome and I kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! Does that make you feel any better? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Well now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club. In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Sorry. I'm not usually like this. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Hey, don't worry. I don't know what I'm like anymore. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Exes. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Why do you keep saying- PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the head, sending him flying across the dance floor. Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER! "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Roxy? Scott gets up. The three square off in a triangle. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know this girl? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What...is...she...talking about? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, You and her?! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It was just a phase. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You had a sexy phase? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I didn't think it would count! It meant nothing. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I was just a little bi-curious. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Do that again and I will end you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Then Gideon best get his pretentious ass up here, '�cos I'm about to kick yours out of the Great White North. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Believe it. An embarrassed Scott watches with the rest of the crowd. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wallace? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,This is happening right? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I mean, this is live? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"With blinding speed, Roxy slips her belt off and WHIPS A RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere. PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out. Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I'd rather be dead than go back. He's a creep, you're a bitch and you all deserve each other. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Meaning? Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm not sure I can hit a girl. They're soft. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"You don't have a choice. Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Her weak point's the back of her knees! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? How does that work? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Whenever we were making out, I- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Okay. As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Sooooo... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Two gin and tonics please. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I thought you didn't drink. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Only on special occasions. Why? Did you want one? Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I guess we really don't know that much about each other do we? Scott seems immediately drunk. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least I know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Oh, like a handy little laminate or something? Let me see if I can find one. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I really think we should split. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,As in '�get out of here'? Or as in '�split split'? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I'd hope you could figure that out. Or did you miss the part where I saved your ass? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,How could I not? I feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Dirty laundry. You're drunk. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, I've had like one drink. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm sick of it. I thought you might be more understanding. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, I JUST- 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You're just another evil ex- boyfriend waiting to happen. Ramona walks off and loudly announces. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Apparently. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know what? I don't know and I don't want to know. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Good. I play better in a bad mood. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"It's not an issue. You know bands, I know battles. We got it covered. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Not only do I want to take part. I want to take them apart. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on first? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's impossible- 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Okay. My bad. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Come on man! I put aside my problems for the music. If I can do that, we can do anything. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? No. I haven't seen her since the other night. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, THANKS KI- 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! WE ARE HERE TO 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Gideon...is here? Where? Stills points to the '�Mystery Geek'�, who smirks and whispers in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"That's Gideon? Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Alright. Let's do this! Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI! The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music. The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in time to the music! Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex Bob-Omb HAMMER DOWN THE FINAL NOTE: "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Getting a life. Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still- applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You seem... different. Knives shrugs, different. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Ramona... Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ramona. I have something I need to tell you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Yeah, I have something to- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"I really, really mean it. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Oh. Okay. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What did you want to tell me? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,That we have to break up. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah...it's not going to work out. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Oh okay... A sleek black '�61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's Gideon. I just...I can't help myself around him. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Bob-omb. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You think we're gonna sell our souls to you? Well then guess- We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass. A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I said '�lesbians'! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,The wha? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Like...with jetpacks? Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Seven. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Aaah! 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Right. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Right. And the year. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I get it. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,She's with Gideon. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Thanks. RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Is Ramona with you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, I just spilled cocoa on my crotch. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Mm. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Whatever. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What if I want the satisfaction? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'm not here to drink. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What if I have a beef...with you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You mean '�The League'�? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I'll show you how ancient of history it is. Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Well I ain't moving...buddy. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Was that not clear? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Because, I'm in love with her. Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"You're kidding right? Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,What the hell is your deal? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Can we please stop all this fighting! Nobody stole anybody. Knives, I dated you and then I dated Ramona. Okay? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You cheated on me with Knives? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No! I cheated on Knives. With you. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Is there a difference? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You weren't wronged? Scott breaks into a flop sweat. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Right? Knives and Ramona stare at Scott. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Ugh. Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,It's complicated. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So why go back? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now... "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That is evil. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"He's like that. Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh? "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I'm sorry it had to end this way. We had a good run, I guess. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You can't say I didn't try. I really fought for you back there. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Uh-huh. The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany, "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Knives? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,So...so alone. DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Ahhhhhh... We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, ...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Wallace, when my journey began, I was living in an ordinary world. Ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call I considered refusing. But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Could you put a robe on and hand me the phone? Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon Graves. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey, pal. I feel terrible about everything. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Sorry, what I meant to say is '�I'm coming over to kill you'�. Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,You seen one... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Your hair looks stupid. The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Whatever. Scott SPLIT KICKS them in the faces, knocking them out. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Stephen, the new line-up rocks. You guys sound better without me. Young Neil? You have learned well. From this point forward, you shall be known as '�Neil'�. And Kim? Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Save it. You're pretentious, the club sucks, I have beef, let's do it. Scott goes straight into fight mode. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No...I want to fight you for me. Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Kim? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,How's it going back there? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Knives! I know you're in here! Don't attack Ra- Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK. They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated on you. Knives steps back, stunned. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I cheated on both of you. And I'm sorry. I was a different guy back then. Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Never felt better. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Oh, you got a fight alright. Scott steps into a fighting stance. Knives joins him. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"Let's both be girls. Ramona knees Gideon in the balls. Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him. Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You're right. I'm not cool enough for Ramona. And you got another thing right. You are blowing up. Right now. Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face. Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Yeah. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,No. This is something I have to face on my own. The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward to confront his dark side. Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward... 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit. He's a super-nice guy. We actually have a lot in common. Scott runs his fingers through his hair. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,What? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Yeah? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"You do? Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness. Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Hey... Where are you going? Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,I dunno. I should probably disappear. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,After all that? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"It's hard, you know? I came here to get away, but the past keeps catching up. I'm tired of people getting hurt because of me. Ramona looks at Knives as she says this. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,I think I understand. Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,"I should tahnk you, though. "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,For what? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,For being the nicest guy I ever dated. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,That's kind of sad. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP, 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,Well... Bye and stuff. 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,"Yeah. And stuff. She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears- "
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,Wha? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP,But what about you? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,RAMONAFLOWERS,ISTP,You want to come with me? 
SCOTTPILGRIMVSTHEWORLD,SCOTTPILGRIM,ISFP, 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Hol�, Mam� Coco. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I used to run like this... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,But now I run like this which is way faster! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,And the winner is... Luchadora Coco! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple-- "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"No, gracias. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,S-s�? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Love you, Mam�! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Hola! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Muchas gracias! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Hey, hey!    Dante! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake. Fist bump. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Good boy, Dante! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Huh? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Oh, yeah, sorry. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I just can't really talk about any of this at home so... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I could never say that... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Uh-uh, my family would freak! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,...Seize your moment? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP," Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward him. Miguel's T�O BERTO , follow with supplies from the market. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Abuelita! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Um...uh... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,He was just showing me his guitar... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Yes, T�o Berto. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"No, no, no! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,It's just Dante... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP, 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I was just shining shoes! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP, But what about tonight? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Well they're having this talent show- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,And I thought I might... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Well, maybe? "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I thought we were done... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Like Mam� Coco's pap�? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,But you're the one who-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I was just-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,But-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP, Miguel... Miguel? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,...and make it come true. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta seize my moment! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Get under, get under! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP, Miguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda room darkened by three figures. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Nothing! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP, Your Abuelita had the most wonderful idea! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,What?!

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Dante!   No, Dante, stop! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,De la Cruz's guitar...?

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"But Pap�, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,If you would just let-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP, PAP� You will listen to your family.    No more music.

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,No... But if I can borrow a guitar-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar? "

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins. "

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Uh, you're all dead. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,That's just Dante. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,But Dante doesn't have any hair. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Oh... 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,It was an accident! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,That's it? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,What happens at sunrise?

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Mmm, nope. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,It's how you walk. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Whoa...""Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!"" Qu� padre! "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,And you can get us in!

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I just followed my-- 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I don't think he's a spirit guide. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I think it's just the right amount of obvious? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Huh? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,Chorizo? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,"Hey, I'm a musician. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP," Pepita leans forward, breathes again, and the glow spreads to reveal a trail of footprints. "
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,My great-great grandpa was a musician.

COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,I am! 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,No!    I need to do this. 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician? 
COCO,MIGUELRIVERA,ESFP,'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it.

JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Huh? Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster. Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her. NEEDY You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed Chip! You goddamned monster! You...ZOMBITCH! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot? God, you're butch. NEEDY Know what this is for? Cutting boxes. She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense. We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer, straddling her and bearing down. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," My tit! Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT, revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY. Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle. MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom. MRS. CHECK Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my God! Oh my God! She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over, gasping and bleeding. MRS. CHECK  "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Hey, Monistat. NEEDY What's up, Vagisil? JENNIFER You and me are going out tonight. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"They're this indie band from the city. I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty. And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you. Come on Needy, it's the weekend! NEEDY It's Thursday. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Thursday counts as the weekend in college. And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now. University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo! Needy continues loading her backpack. JENNIFER  Please, please you're a social disease? NEEDY I have to study. Jennifer pouts. With an outstretched finger, she draws a dramatic X in the air over Needy and boos loudly. JENNIFER "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge... heart. So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay? NEEDY Okay. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here! CHIP That's fucking weird. NEEDY (straightening her CLOTHES) I'd better hurry. CHIP You always do what Jennifer tells you to do. Needy pulls her NECKLACE out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart-shaped ""B.F.F."" charm at Chip. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP, Guess who's got the whip `til 11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and it's all mine. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style! She does a sexy little dance in the doorway, then notices CHIP. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,It smells like Thai food in here. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Okay, let's go to the club. The three of them shuffle onto the porch. Needy locks the door. CHIP The Carousel is not a club. JENNIFER Eat my ass, Chip. You're just jello `cause you're not invited. CHIP I'm not jello! That place is gross. Everyone there has a mustache. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it. The girls scamper toward the car. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"God, I can't wait until I'm old enough to get wasted. Have you ever had peach schnapps? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Peach schnapps are excellent. They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke. A teenage guy, CRAIG, passes by and waves. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," What up, Craig. She elbows Needy and makes a GAGGING GESTURE. JENNIFER  He thinks he's cute enough for me. No wonder he's in retard math. Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one awkwardly. Needy notices AHMET FROM INDIA, a FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT, standing by himself away from the crowd. NEEDY Hey, it's Ahmet from India. The foreign exchange guy. He's all by himself. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that. NEEDY He seems okay. He's got that cool elephant statue in his locker. JENNIFER Do you think he's circumcised? I always wanted to try sea cucumber. NEEDY Ew! ROMAN DUDA saunters up to Jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer. He snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her. ROMAN You're smoking dicks now, Jen? JENNIFER What? I like the Wides. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Arrest me, pfft! You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman! ROMAN Two more months and I'm on the force for real. Then I'll be able to cuff you whenever the hell I want. He grips her wrist and twists it behind her back. JENNIFER How will I wait that long? She paws Roman's crotch discreetly. Needy winces. ROMAN Not here, babe. I gotta keep my nose clean. NEEDY "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"You can tell they're from the city. ROMAN Yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos. JENNIFER You would think that. You're such a small-time Gomer. I wish we had more guys like that in Devil's Kettle. All stylish and shit. Needy nods dumbly. She stares at the band, awestruck. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come on! It'll be like Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl. She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just boys. Morsels. We have all the power, don't you know that? She plants her hands on Needy's CHEST. JENNIFER  These things are like smart bombs. Point `em in the right direction and shit gets real. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments. NIKOLAI I hope we can live up to such...high praise. NEEDY Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil's Kettle? You live in the city, right? NIKOLAI Yeah. But I think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas. Plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us. JENNIFER Can I show you my appreciation right now? Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"What? Are you scared of rock stars too? NEEDY Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,I think the singer wants me. NEEDY Only because he thinks you're a virgin. I heard them talking. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Yeah, right! I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I couldn't even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas. NEEDY Oh my God. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do innocent. I'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine. NEEDY He's way too old for you. JENNIFER Don't cock-block me, Needy. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on fire. Oh God, I'm burning! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Okay...okay... She slumps against Nikolai's chest. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," I want to see your van. C'mon Needy, let's go to the van. NEEDY Why? Why should we? We have the Malibu. Let's just get out of here. We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce! Please? I'm starving. JENNIFER Needy, stop it. Just stop it! She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar. Needy staggers after them slowly, watching. Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence. Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Are you scared? Needy nods. Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street. Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway. NEEDY "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,But she's long gone. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Happy Friday!, D-bag! NEEDY You-- you're all right! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? NEEDY Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and... 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Needy, you're delusional. I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but I'm fine. NEEDY "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,You do have a tendency to overreact. Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster? 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Anyone we know? 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Sucks to be them, I guess. She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse. NEEDY I don't get it. What's wrong with you? Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"What's wrong with you? I mean, besides the obvious surface flaws. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Don't talk to yourself. It's one of your more freakish Needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords. Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading her fingers to display her filthy fingernails. JENNIFER  Eww, you need a mani bad. You'd better find a Chinese chick to buff your situation! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,No way! Parrish ate shit? 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Oh look, they're united in grief. That'll last. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"CHIP What? NEEDY You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door? That was Jennifer. But she didn't talk. She just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. She looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something. She was all bloody. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Hi! 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss. You are crying about Craig, right? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I know. I was close to him too. You know, I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out. JONAS You-- you did? JENNIFER Yeah. I was probably the last person to talk to him. Like, ever. Literally. JONAS Wow. What did he say? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Well, we got to talking about you, actually. And do you know what he said? He said you were like a brother to him. Not a bro. An actual brother. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I know, I know. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Forget it. It's too intense. JONAS What? Please, Jen, you've gotta tell me! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple. Isn't that so weird? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's broken. JONAS "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Come with me. Just for a while. We'll help each other get through this nightmare. It's what Craig would have wanted. Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we see the FALLS rushing into the lake. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"(firmly covering his MOUTH) Shutties! She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,What? 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Mm-hmm. They're waiting. JONAS Uh, okay... Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down and working him with her hand. Jonas moans, still eyeing the animals. JENNIFER Do you miss Craig? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Don't worry. You're going to see your buddy again. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"No. She smiles and shakes her head. Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree. We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood... "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I feel sooo scrumptious! She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from the wound. NEEDY Good for you. JENNIFER You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate. NEEDY Yeah. JENNIFER It's that good. Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast. She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the FLAME to her tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I tell it like it is. Besides, you should be happy for me. I'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar. NEEDY Jesus didn't invent the calendar. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,So blow it off. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Pooh. I'm crossing you out. She draws a mini-X in the air. Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie- chart illustrating the intersecting calls. CHIP is panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the background, Chip's little sister CAMILLE bangs on a piano. Red police lights flash outside the picture window. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers? NEEDY I have to meet Chip at McCullum Park. JENNIFER Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there? NEEDY "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Bo-ring! 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"No. I feel like boo-boo. My skin is breaking out. My hair is dull and lifeless. God, it's like I'm one of the normal girls! Needy smooths her own hair self-consciously. NEEDY Are you PMS-ing or something? JENNIFER PMS isn't real, Needy. It was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem crazy. NEEDY Oh. Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat, annoyed by their talking. MR. WROBLEWSKI ...As I was saying, Needy and Jennifer, I finally have some good news to share with all of you. The members of the rock group Soft Shoulder have decided to extend a helping hand to our community. A ripple of excitement in the room. A girl seated in the front row is wearing a Soft Shoulder T-SHIRT. MR. WROBLEWSKI  As you know, their song ""Through the Trees"" has become our unofficial anthem of unity and healing. So, they've decided to release it as a benefit single. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Yeah. It's poorly produced. Could the bass be any lower in the mix? NEEDY No offense, but you look kind of drained. Is everything all right? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing off or something. NEEDY What's wearing off? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"No, dick ridge! Just forget I said anything. COLIN GRAY, the punk/goth boy we met earlier, approaches Jennifer nervously as she exits the classroom. Needy drops behind them, eavesdropping. COLIN "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus. COLIN Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you something. JENNIFER Oh. You want to know if I'll go out with you. COLIN No! Well-- yeah. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Just go ahead with the pitch. Colin fidgets awkwardly. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I don't like boxing movies. COLIN It's not...fuck it. Never mind. He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected. Jennifer watches him leave. JENNIFER Wait! Colin turns around. JENNIFER  Why don't you just come by my place tonight? I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this girl who's like, half-sushi. I guess she has sex through her blowhole or something. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I'll text you my address. Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,I'm used to guys asking me out. NEEDY Colin's a really nice guy. JENNIFER He's into maggot-rock. He wears nail polish. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP, Hi Chip. Needy puts her arm around Chip protectively. JENNIFER  I gotta go parlez French. Slam you later. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"You made it. COLIN What's going on? This isn't really your house, is it? JENNIFER No baby. This is our house, just for you and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy. Colin is totally dumbstruck. COLIN Do you even know my last name? JENNIFER Silly. I've been sending you signals all year. Couldn't you tell? You give me such a wettie. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP, Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles. JENNIFER You scared? I thought boys like you were into vermin. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Oh, don't you dare pass out! I need you to be conscious. COLIN I gotta go... "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I need you frightened. Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin cries out in pain. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"God, enough screaming already. You're such a cliche. NEEDY Get out! JENNIFER But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties. She winks conspiratorially at Needy. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'? 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped. NEEDY I'm calling the police. JENNIFER Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets. Right? Needy nods, terrified. JENNIFER  Remember the night of the fire? NEEDY Yeah, it rings a bell. JENNIFER Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Guys? Where are we going? 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Are you guys rapists?! 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Yes...yes! Of course I'm a virgin! I've never done sex ever. I don't even know how. So maybe you should find some other girl who does. Know how. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Just let me finish. So they drove all the way out to the falls. I tried to figure out an escape, but it was so dark out there... "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP, My name is Jennifer. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Please let me go. I'll do anything. Anything you want. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP," Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or something. Hey, I could be on your street team! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Please... 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Being tortured would make most girls black out or something. But I'm so hard core, I was with them the whole time. I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right through my heart. NEEDY They...killed you. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I'm here, aren't I? She shakes her head, annoyed with Needy. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Whatever. Anyway, I don't really remember what happened after that. I just-- woke up a few hours later and found my way back, somehow. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I couldn't bring myself to hurt you. I mean, I'm a really good friend. But I felt so hungry. I had to do something. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Ahmet. You made it out. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Ever since then, I just somehow knew what I needed to do to be strong. And when I'm full--like I am right now--I'm like, immortal! I can do stuff like this. Jennifer jams the CUTICLE STICK into her own forearm and drags it through her flesh. Needy screams and covers her mouth. JENNIFER  No biggie. Watch. She pulls out the stick. The wound seals over instantly. Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"You know. Full. Like full of tasty morsels. Needy shakes her head, not comprehending. JENNIFER  Forget it. You'd probably tell on me anyway. Not that anyone would believe you. You always think the world is coming to an end. NEEDY What about my mom's Kia? Why did you attack me out there? Why were you covered in blood? You didn't even look human. Jennifer rolls her eyes. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having. We're all concerned. Especially Chip. I think he's having second thoughts about you. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"My, aren't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday? NEEDY GET OUT! JENNIFER Come on. Let me stay the night. We can play ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" like we used to. She smiles seductively. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,You said to leave. So I'm outtie- 5000. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"CHIP! CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect. JENNIFER  Didn't you hear me calling your name? CHIP You weren't calling my name. JENNIFER Yes, I was. CHIP I couldn't hear it. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I think you were maybe spacing out. You were like this: Derrrrr. She mimics a blank, drooling expression. CHIP I was? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy. CHIP I know. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Are you worried? `Cause I'm super- stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night. CHIP She hasn't been the same for weeks. JENNIFER I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,I feel bad telling you this. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Needy and Colin were intimate. By that I mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"That's what she wants you to believe. But trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of. Total varsity moves. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Well, apparently he had a thing for me-- no surprise there. And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so I agreed to a little pity date. Colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy. But he wanted to go too far, so I left after a few minutes. Next thing I knew, they'd found... She sniffles, wiping her eye. JENNIFER  ...what was left of him. CHIP "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Huh? CHIP Never mind. JENNIFER I'm sorry you had to hear this from me. I'm just so worried about Needy. She's losing her shit. Colin was her everything. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Well, you've been talking to her more than I have. How bad is it? CHIP It's bad, man. It's bad. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with. CHIP Oh, you have no idea. JENNIFER I just can't believe she would do this to you. I care so much about you, Chip. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Needy didn't deserve a boy like you. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Ooh, you're so salty! CHIP Yeah, you too. JENNIFER Say it like you mean it. CHIP You're so salty. I need water. It burns. The salty burns my mouth. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Say I'm better than Needy. CHIP What? Why? JENNIFER We really shouldn't be doing this. She pulls away from him, feigning a guilty conscience. CHIP "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Natch. She resumes kissing him enthusiastically. CHIP This feels weird. Can we go somewhere else? JENNIFER I have just the place. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,You're in big trouble anyway. Come on. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma. She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of filthy, freezing water. CHIP What are you doing? JENNIFER Swimming. CHIP Ha ha. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Come on in, Chip. Show me your breast stroke. CHIP The water looks disgusting. JENNIFER It's not so bad. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I'm sorry. I was just trying to make you laugh. I think now, more than ever, we need laughter. We've both lost a close friend. CHIP nods sadly. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I feel so empty. CHIP Me too. JENNIFER Please come here and kiss me again. Make all this madness go away. Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees. He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to the ladder. The sound of buzzing flies grows louder. Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Fuck this J.V. shit! Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess, hovering ten feet above the pool. Her eyes burn. Her skin is corpselike. She's drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"God, do you have to undermine everything I do? You're such a player-hater. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got any more harsh digs? "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,And now I'm eating your boyfriend! See? At least I'm consistent. NEEDY Why do you need him? Huh? She begins to weep. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I am not insecure. God, what a joke! How could I be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen! NEEDY Yeah, two years ago. When you were socially relevant. JENNIFER I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT! "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki. Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background, Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an eight-foot handle off the pool deck. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"I go both ways. She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous. Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear. As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle. Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Got a tampon? Needy shakes her head mutely. JENNIFER  Thought I'd ask. You seemed like you might be pluggin'. 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,Fuck this noise. I'm out. You losers are more trouble then you're worth. She continues climbing. NEEDY 
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Nah. I mean, you say I've been a bad friend all these years. I might as well throw you a bone. "
JENNIFERSBODY,JENNIFERCHECK,ESTP,"Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing. The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of the police. NEEDY V.O. Even in her last moments of life, she somehow managed to be cooler than me. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Step out of the car please, sir. The motorist squints at the man with the strange apparatus. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"I need you to step out of the car, sir. The man opens his door and emerges. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Would you hold still please, sir. A hard pneumatic sound. The man flops back against the car. Blood trickles from a hole in the middle of his forehead. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Hold still. He opens the free eye and rolls his head off the sight to give himself stereo. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Shit. He stands and jacks out the spent casing which jangles against the rocks. He stoops for it and puts it in his shirt pocket. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Ain't got no water. On the seat next to the man is an HK machine pistol. Moss looks at it. He looks back at the man. The man is still staring at him. Without lowering his eyes Moss reaches in and takes the pistol. Moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle back over his shoulder. He snaps the clip off the machine pistol, checks it and snaps it back on. Moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp that covers the truck bed. A load of brick-sized brown parcels each wrapped in plastic. He throws the tarp back over the load and crosses back to the open cab door. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I told you I ain't got no agua. You speak English? A blank look. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...Where's the last guy? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Ultimo hombre. Last man standing, must've been one. Where'd he go? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"If you stopped... to watch your backtrack... you're gonna shoot my dumb ass. He doesn't see anything. He lowers the glass, thinking. He raises the glass again. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...But. If you stopped... you stopped in shade. He sets off. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,It's full a money. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,At the gettin' place. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,No. I found it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, MOSS What? Quit hollerin'. He walks back sipping the beer and sprawls on the couch. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Just keep it up. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,That'll work. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,All right. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, MOSS Yeah. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Goin' out. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I'm fixin' to do somethin' dumbern hell but I'm goin' anyways. He starts toward the front door. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Well then I'll tell her myself. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Hello?... No answer. He opens the door. The man's body is still held upright by the shoulder harness but his head, flayed by buckshot, is tipped away. Moss glances at the bed of the truck. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Moss turns and half stumbles, half dives into the river. Underwater a very dull whump followed by the fizz of buckshot. Moss breaks the surface of the water, gasping, and looks "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Goddamnit. He is looking out at the river. His boots are drifting by. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,How much? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,This. And the gas. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,What way would that be? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Didn't mean nothin'. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things. A beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I don't know. Will there? Beat. The proprietor turns and coughs. Chigurh stares. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,With what? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything? The proprietor looks at him, uncomfortable, looks away. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You already asked me that. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,See about closing. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,What time do you close? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Now is not a time. What time do you close. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"You don't know what you're talking about, do you? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I said you don't know what you're talking about. Chigurh chews. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...What time do you go to bed. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I could come back then. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"You said that. He continues to stare, chewing. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You live in that house behind the store? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You've lived here all your life? A beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You married into it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You married into it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Call it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Yes. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Just call it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it. A long beat. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Everything. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You stand to win everything. Call it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Well done. He hands it across. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...Don't put it in your pocket. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is. He turns and goes. The proprietor watches him. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Odessa. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Not we, you. Stay with your mother. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Right now it's midnight Sunday. When the courthouse opens nine hours from now someone's gonna be callin in the vehicle number off the inspection plate on my truck. And around nine- thirty they'll show up here. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP," MOSS C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again. Carla Jean begins peevishly tossing things into a bag: "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Things happened. I can't take 'em back. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,This his truck? He is opening the door and looking at the plate riveted inside. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Screwgie. The man reaches into a pocket and hands over a screwdriver. As Chigurh works it under the plate: 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...Who slashed his tires? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Thank you. Chigurh plays the flashlight around the scene. Dead bodies on the ground. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...Where's the transponder? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Hold this please. He bends down and takes a 9 mm. Glock off of one of the dead bodies and checks the clip. The other man is returning from the truck. He hands Chigurh a small electronic receiver. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...You getting anything on this? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"All right... Chigurh stands and holds his hand out for his flashlight. The driver hands it to him. Chigurh shines it in his face and shoots him through the forehead. As the man falls Chigurh pans the light to the other man who has watched his partner drop. He looks up, puzzled, and is shot as well. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Yes I did. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Where does he work? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Where does he work? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Where does he work? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon. Carla Jean nods at the document case. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yes I do. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Well I got a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Uh-huh. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You should be used to that. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, MOSS Yes ma'am? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I shall return. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Take me to a motel. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Just someplace cheap. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,The what? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Is Llewelyn there? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"You expect him? The woman's voice is old, querulous: "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"I need the Larry Mahan's in black, size 11. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You sell socks? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,White is all I wear. You got a bathroom? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here. The cab rolls slowly up the lot. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...Keep going. His pivoting point-of-view of his room. The window shows a part between the curtains. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...Keep going. Don't stop. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,It's all right. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I want you to take me to another motel. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You're already in a jackpot. I'm trying to get you out of it. Now take me to a motel. The driver reaches up for the bill then turns the cab out of the parking lot onto the hiway. Moss turns to look at the receding lights of the motel. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Uh-huh. Double ought. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You have camping supplies? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Uh-huh. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Somethin' like that. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Never mind. I want a tent. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,The kind with the most poles. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Could I get another room. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"No, I want to keep my room, and get another one. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms? She inclines her head to look under the counter. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,What about one forty-two. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"No, one forty-two. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Driving slowly down the street with frequent glances down at the receiver on the seat next to him. The receiver lights ups and bleeps one time. Chigurh slows and looks around at the buildings that line the two-lane highway. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,The receiver is bleeping slowly as the car creeps along. Up at a distant intersection is Charlie Goodnight's Del Rio Motel. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"He is slowly driving the parking lot, the receiver now in his lap. The beeping frequency peaks and then starts to fall off. Chigurh puts the truck in reverse and eases back to the peak. His point-of-view: window with parted curtains. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Moss pulls three wire hangers off the closet rack. He takes them to the bureau and picks up a sidecutter. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"He walks over to the bathroom. He turns on its light, looks. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Moss snips the last of the wire hangers' hooks off with the sidecutter. He wraps the three hooks with duct tape to make a sturdier one. He wraps more tape to attach this hook to the end of the three-link pole. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"From a bag he withdraws a twelve-gauge automatic shotgun fitted with a silencer big around as a beer can. He checks the loads. He picks up the regularly beeping receiver, turns it off, and slips it into his pocket. He hoists the air tank. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"He is standing on the chair below the airduct, stooping to pick up the jury-rigged pole leaning nearby. He straightens and feeds the length of the pole into the duct, using the joints to angle it in. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Peering along the airduct, both hands up next to one ear awkwardly maneuvering the pole. He lays the far, hooked end over the protruding corner of the document case. He pulls. The pole slides off the case. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"He stands at the door of Moss's first room. He eases an ear against it. He steps back. He punches out the lock cylinder with the airgun and kicks in the door, raising the shotgun. A Mexican in a guyabera reclines on one of the two double beds. He is scrabbling for a machine pistol on the nightstand. Chigurh fires three times quickly. The damped blasts have the low resonance of chugs into a bottle. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Also frozen, back against the wall outside the room, to one side of the open door. After a beat he steps back into the open doorway leveling the gun. Inside the room: no movement. Much of the man on the bed is spattered against the chewed-up headboard. The bathroom door is ajar, its light on. A long beat. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Gun leveled, at the open door. Again, no movement. He advances into the room, gun pointing at the bathroom door. As he advances he swings the gun briefly over at the closet door and fires. The splintered-in door reveals no occupant. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,He uses the shotgun barrel to push open what's left of the bathroom door. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,How'd you find it? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Doin' what. The old man gazes at the road. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"One room, one night. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You on all night? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,For you. I ain't asking you to do anything illegal. The clerk looks at the hundred-dollar bill without reaching. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"There just ain't no way. He sits up and turns on the bedside lamp. The shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed. Moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it and upends the money onto the bed. He feels the bottom of the case, squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand out, looking for a false bottom. He eyeballs the case, turning it over and around. He starts riffling money packets. He finds one that binds. It has hundreds on the outside but ones inside with the centers cut out. In the hollow is a sending unit the size of a Zippo lighter. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"I'm not going to hurt you. I need you to -- The windshield stars. A quick second round pushes part of the windshield in. Rounds come in without pause, cracking sheet metal, blowing the cab's rear window into the truckbed, twisting the rear- view. A round seems to have caught the driver in the throat: a gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe, blowing out blood. Moss, quicker to react, has already ducked below the dash. A snap of the driver's head and a new freshet of blood from a shot to the head. The screams turn to low gurgles. Moss, jammed almost in to the driver's lap, frantically gropes for the shift. He throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator, driving blind as bullets continue to pour in. He raises his head enough to see his side-view. It shows sluing, bouncing, empty street, rough guide for steering. A tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it, the driver's body swaying in its restraint. The passenger side window shatters: we are passing the gunman. Now Moss sits up to steer looking out front. Behind him through the shot-out back window the dark street is suddenly punctured by muzzleflash. It comes, for the first time, with a report: the low chug of the muted shotgun. Rattle of shot against sheet metal. Moss floors the gas to roar into a turn. The street sweeping out of view behind him produces one more chugging muzzleflash. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I'll give you five hundred bucks for your shirt and your coat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yeah. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,It's right here. Give me the coat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Gimme the clothes. The youth starts to peel them. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...And let me have your beer. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Doctor. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,...Medico. Por favor. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"I know, I've seen him. Sort of. Wells is surprised. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,How would you describe him? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP, MOSS Sugar? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I know how he found me. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I know what it is. He won't find me again. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Not any way. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I been immobile. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I'm retired. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I'm a welder. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yes. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I didn't say braze. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,What did I say? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yeah. I was in Nam. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,So what does that make me? Your buddy? Wells sits smiling at him. A beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in. Wells' smile stays in place. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Why would he go to Odessa? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Maybe he should be worried. About me. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,What product. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,No I don't have it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Hello Carson. Let's go to your room. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Why would I let you do that? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"If you knew, you would have it with you. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I know something better. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I know where it's going to be. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,It will be brought to me and placed at my feet. Wells wipes his mouth with his hand. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Let me ask you something. If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule? Another beat. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You mean the nature of this conversation? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Yes? Another beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Not in the sense that you mean. Moss doesn't answer. Chigurh gives him a beat, and then: "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...You need to come see me. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Who is this. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You know who it is. A beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...You need to talk to me. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I don't need to talk to you. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Why would I care where you're going. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Do you know where I'm going? No answer. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...I know where you are. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yeah? Where am I? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yeah. I know where you're going. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,All right. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You know she won't be there. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,It doesn't make any difference where she is. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,So what're you goin' up there for. A beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"You know how this is going to turn out, don't you? "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,No. Do you? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all. Moss slams the phone onto its hook, then slams it twice more for good measure. Chigurh, in the hotel room, cradles his phone. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I don't know. American citizens. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"You do, I reckon. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I don't know. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,No sir. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I got an overcoat on. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,No sir. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yes sir. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,No sir. I'm a veteran. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yes sir. Two tours. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Good. I need everything else. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Yes she does. Put her on. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I don't care what time it is. Don't you hang up this phone. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP, MOSS Hey. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,You know what's goin' on? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,What did you tell him? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,What makes you say that? 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Meet me at the Heart of Texas motel in El Paso. I'm gonna give you the money and put you on a plane. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,She'll be all right. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,I don't think anybody'll bother her. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Who are you? A long beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Yes. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,He gave Acosta's people a receiver. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,That's foolish. You pick the one right tool. Chigurh inclines his head toward the pocked glass of the picture window. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,That depends. Do you see me? The man stares at him for a beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"A driving point-of-view approaching Chigurh, who leans against his Ramcharger, its hood up, stopped on the shoulder on the opposite side of the road. Reverse shows a man in an El Camino. Chickens in stacked cages squawk and flutter in the bed. The man slows and rolls his window down to lean out. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,You from around here? The man emerges with jumper cables. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,What airport would you use. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Airport. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I don't know. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed. The man stares at him. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,"Hey yourself. The woman is pretty in a roadhouse-veteran sort of way. Her voice carries a flat echo, slapping off the surface of the pool. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,That's me. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Waitin' for my wife. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Half. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Lookin' for what's comin'. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Then you'll like me. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,LLEWELYNMOSS,ISTP,Ma'am I know what beer leads to. The woman laughs. Before the plane overwhelms it: 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,No. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,No. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I wouldn't worry about it. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,No. But I gave my word. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,To your husband. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen. A beat. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Yes. Things fall into place. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,I'm all right. Let me just sit here a minute. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,All right. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,What will you take for that shirt? The two boys look at each other. They look back. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Any damn shirt. I need something to wrap around my head and I need a sling for this arm. Boy 2 unbuttons his shirt. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Tie this for me. The two boys look at each other. 
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,"...Just tie it. Boy 2, the one now wearing a T-shirt, ties it. Chigurh pulls a bill clip from his pocket and draws a bill out with his teeth. He holds it out to the boy. "
NOCOUNTRYFOROLDMEN,ANTONCHIGURH,INTP,Take it. Take it and you didn't see me. I was already gone. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not feeling well this morning.  No.  Food poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so long to call in, but I've been vomiting. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm sorry. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Why what? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so... "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ," Well, I didn't want to assume. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really think of much to say probably. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here.  I didn't mean to -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"It's okay, really. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Rockville Center. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you.  I thought that earlier in the diner.  That's why I was looking at you.  You work at Borders, right? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Really?  Because -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,-- because I go there all the time.  I don't think I ever saw you before. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't have one. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I like it. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I can't remember. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't really know how -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You think that could possibly be a full time job?  How many hair colors could there be? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm sure you would. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You sure?  That doesn't sound -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Oh, I doubt that's the case. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm Joel. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know any jokes about your name. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know what that means. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm nut nuts. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It means ""merciful"", right? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"See, I wouldn't think that about you. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't know.  I was... You seemed nice, so -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Well, anyway... Sorry. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yes? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,That's okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some stuff I need to -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,(pulling journal from briefcase) Probably see you at the book store. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You're sure?  It's cold. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Where do you live? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm not a stalker. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's okay.  I didn't think you were. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I like to read. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah?  I can't remember that album very well.  I remember liking it.  But -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Sort of, um... "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,What? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Well, I wouldn't want to be -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Take care. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Um -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Very much. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Frost? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's pretty. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Cheers. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm fine. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No, I'm okay for now. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,What do you want to hear? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You just say.  I'm not really -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Well, I should probably get going. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,No.  I -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Thanks. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, I guess. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting. I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know what to say. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I think about that. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I do have a tendency to use that word too much. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Thanks. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,No. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No, not at all. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Oh, yeah. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,That's scary sounding. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I think so. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, Sounds good.  But right now I should go. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so... "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yes. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Tomorrow? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It was snowing. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"The driver waved.  So casual, friendly. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I might be making a mistake. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Fuck you, Clementine. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I should maybe talk to you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened...  I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together.  You'll know everything again and... "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Clementine. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,How could she have done this to me?  How could anyone do this to anyone? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,What's happening here? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Gotta get home.  How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What a fucking monster she is! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Them. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,How exactly is this going to work tonight? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's happening now!  I'm already in my brain. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's already started.  I'm home in my bed. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,My name is Joel Barish.  I have an appointment. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Not great. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Well... I did. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, It was a mess.  I don't know how it got this way... 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,So then she just stops calling. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Any messages, Carmen? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Why would she do that? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,She's punishing me for being honest.  I should just go to her house. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,They can't erase memories.  It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's three. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I can't believe you wrecked my car. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You're driving drunk.  It's pathetic. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Well it is pathetic.  And fucking irresponsible.  You could've killed somebody. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight.  Isn't that how you get people to like you? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Let me drive you home. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Look at it out here.  It's falling apart. I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,That must be the guy I saw you with. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Where are you going? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Oh shit.  I remember this. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Let's talk about it later. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't think we're ready. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, I don't want to talk about this here. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Clem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Oh, thank God.  It's going. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"It's going, Clementine.  All the crap and hurt and disappointment.  It's all being wiped away. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Me, too. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"So, um -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You're drunk. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No, it isn't that. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I just don't have anything very interesting about my life. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,How's the chicken? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,No.  Thanks. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's good. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, Tangerine? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,No. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ," No!  Jesus, No! "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"...die right now, Clem.  I'm just... happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You have to stop this! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased!  Stop it now! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, Yes indeed. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I loved you on this day.  I love this memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,What do you mean? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Where?  Where?  Where? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I must be about two. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you.  I don't want to lose... 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I really want her to pick me up.  It's weird how strong that desire is. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I loved you so much this day.  On my bed in your panties.  I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,There's this guy! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"There's this guy.  I heard him talking in my apartment.  He's one of the eraser guys.  And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's such a feeling of security. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,They found us before.  The plan didn't work.  I don't know what to do now. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill after this. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't want to fight you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm too scared to even throw a punch. When I tell people this story I leave that part out. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you. Remember? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, JOEL 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Happy Birthday. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I scoured the city for it. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it later. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, That's where I live.  Lived. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"It was horrifying, seeing my father like that. There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure.  And he saw failure in me, too, written in my future. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride it out.  Hiding is clearly not working. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I want to enjoy my little time left with you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Do you remember what we talked about? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"God, I should know.  Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No!  I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Right.  Something black though. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,We did talk about Naomi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I'm sure, I said. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't think of anything to say.  There were long silences. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,And I didn't have an argument. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I dropped you off after.  You said -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's very late. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,This was our first time. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Naomi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You take it.  I don't know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I told her today I need to end it. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I did it.  I guess that means something. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and -- "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy?  If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"No.  I just need some space, maybe. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's not somebody else. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Is there a Clementine who works here? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Hi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm not a stalker.  But I needed to see you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'd like to... take you out or something. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Not yet.  Not married. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I just think that you have some kind of... quality that seems really important to me. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I remember that speech really well. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You had the whole human race pegged. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I still thought you were going to save me.  Even after that. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"It would be different, if we could just give it another go around. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Thanks, guys. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Hi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say hello. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Go back to sleep. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,In a minute. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,So you don't mind? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Okay.  I wish you could come. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I hope you get your work done. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Just a little overworked, maybe. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I remember you turned around.  Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I remember. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, you told me that later. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,No one. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You were down by the surf.  I could just make you out in the dark. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Hi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You said... 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You know what I did. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You said -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm Joel. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"You mean, like... "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.  I think your name is magic. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Enjoy it.  Say good-bye. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I know what you mean.  That's why I stopped. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't think I've slept in a year. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,yeah? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Okay. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I love her. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I think she's great. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Seems too coincidental that way. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, yeah.  It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Um, no. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I do sort of live with somebody though. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Female. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,What are you doing? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, Clementine. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I hesitated for what seemed like forever. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I knew. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's dark. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Naomi. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I think we should go. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, I really should go.  I really need to catch my ride. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt like I was a scared little kid.  I thought you knew that about me.  I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.  You said, ""so go"" with such disdain. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I walked out the door.  There's no more memory. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I love you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I know, I know.  It's been a long time. Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great! Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free. Okay, good! "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's been a pretty lonely couple of years. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Well, it was my fault -- the break-up. I'm sorry. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I miss you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, Oh!  Great.  That's great! 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,So you think the dissertation will get published? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Tomorrow? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Hi, Naomi, it's Joel. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,How's it going? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I know.  I had to take the day to think. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I just got in. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Yeah, I suppose so. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,There you are. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I had a good time last night.  I really did. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,We'll speak soon. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I just walked in. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Oddly enough, I do. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I guess so. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know.  What if it breaks? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I think I should go back. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Listen, did you want to make love? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Have sex.  Y'know -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Did you send this?  Is it a joke? 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you.  Who would even know to do this? "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,That's what you have to say?  How could it be true?  I never even heard of any procedure like this.  It's a joke. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,It's true. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Look, I have to go.  I have to think. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Says you were a bully... 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"That's what it says.  You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ, I sort of do.  But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up enough to be erotic. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You're so beautiful. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"Hi, it's Joel. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,"I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you. "
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,You must have been crazy. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I don't know.  Panties and -- 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,Jesus. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,I can't stop thinking about you. 
ETERNALSUNSHINEOFTHESPOTLESSMIND,JOELBARISH,ISFJ,What old mill?  Is that somewhere we -- 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, A people should know when they are conquered. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,At the first signal release the catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I hope not, because I'm going to be leading them. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Why don't they know they're already dead? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, Hold steady... steady... 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Steady... 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Caesar. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I don't think there's anyone left to fight. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Should Caesar permit, I'll go home. I've been away too long.  I've forgotten my wife's face and I barely know my son. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ," Come, Caesar... "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"For the glory of the empire, sire. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"They honor you, Caesar. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Highness. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ," Caesar, you do the lady injustice. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ," If you'll excuse me, Highness. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"What, Gallus, losing your other hand? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,And the women of your village will crave your touch even more. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"What's your name, son? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,The name suits you. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"You're dying because you love Rome, as I do. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Neither have I.  Rome for us lives here... (he touches his heart) ... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Yes, it's a glorious place. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ," If you want to stay on, I support you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I'll return after a season at home. Maybe two. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Should the Gods so bless me.  I would be thankful. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, I'm going home. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,No. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I'm a soldier, not a politician. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ," GAIUS If your heart lies with the people, I would back you for the Senate. I'm sure Gracchus would as well. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I can't do that. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,My men have been fighting for five solid days.  They're too busy dying to go on dress parade. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, Caesar. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I never acquired the art, sir. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Caesar, I am honored but -- "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness.  You brought civilization and justice to the farthest -- "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Yes, Caesar. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,You're not dying. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Caesar, you do me honor -- but your son has pride of place for succession. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I shall, Caesar. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,You have always been my father. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, That's not true. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I lost too many men. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I don't know. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I never acquired your comfort with it. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the battle. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I will always serve the ideals of Rome. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"May I be permitted to go, Highness? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea.  All that was a different life. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,It was more honest. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I thank you for your prayers. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance.  Bring me your solace and your wisdom.  Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword.  Keep them safe until my return.  Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air.  Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Quintus -- ? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,What is it?  Is he ill? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,How did he die? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,How did he die? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"How will the world speak your name now, old man? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,What -- ?! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Quintus -- 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Quintus, what -- ? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, My family?! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"What about my family, Quintus? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Have you ever done this before? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Killed a man with a sword? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor.  You don't want to hack me up now.  You want one clean stroke. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere.  Quite a spray. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck -- 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Put the point of your sword here... you want one, good blow right at this spot -- "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, Am I in Hades? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Gladiator. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Nothing more. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, The Emperor -- will he be there? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,He give it personally? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,You knew Marcus? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,No. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Bigger arena.  Same killing. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,No. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,This isn't my home. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Perhaps one day you'll return. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Yes, but -- "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,What -- ? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS! "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,This isn't your battle. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"General, perform well and there will be riches for you. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I knew your brother would send assassins.  I didn't think he would send his best. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, Don't lie to me. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Don't. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,My son was innocent. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I want your brother dead. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,How do you plan it? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,So the crown passes to your son. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,What is your son's name? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I weep for him. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,What can you tell me? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I was a General. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,It doesn't take courage to kill. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I'm sorry. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I had a father.  He wasn't really my father but I cared for him very much. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Where is my army? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Yes.  But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, The Felix Regiment will never be defeated. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I want Commodus dead. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream.  I will die for that dream. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,He did. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"As will I, Commodus.  As will I. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I only have ancestors because of you, brother.  You killed everything that ever lived alongside me. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,This is the new home you cursed me to.  And I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Why don't you ask your father that? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"I have more power as a slave in the arena than I could ever have as a free man.  As the Colosseum goes, the people go.  As the people go, the Empire goes. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"No, Caesar... I will show you. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"The Felix Regiment will come from here.  We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here.  Once inside, my archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter and join you -- we'll attack here -- "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,-- a covert assault from within. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Probably. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"But if we aren't... think of the glory.  Do you remember glory, Gladiator? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Then be worthy of him.  The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Was it Centurion...?  General...? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,A soldier knows a soldier. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,No -- 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"You said something to me once.  You said in this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Do you recall those words? "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"Then be remembered proudly.  This is your time, Proximo.  Stand at my side and be what you were.  What you truly are.  One last time. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,You pox-ridden bastard -- ! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, A quarter?! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Lucilla -- 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Good. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,You've told me this already. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Lucilla... why are you here? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,No. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Yes. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, I will. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,And if I should not survive... swear to me that you will honor my family in your prayers always. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Shhh... my heart breaks enough. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,But -- 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,We were betrayed. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,You're not coming? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Old friend... 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Where is he? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I forgive you. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Throw down your weapons or we will kill you. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ, FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Captain? 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,(re: Commodus and the others) Where are they going?! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,For my wife! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,For my son! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,For my father! 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,We who are about to die salute you. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,Rome... you are better than this. Look inside yourselves.  I challenge you to find your true voice.  Help the Senate speak for you.  Make them your champion... And dare to think what could be. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,I give you back the dream. 
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"When everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take them home. "
GLADIATOR,MAXIMUSDECIMUSMERIDIUS,ENTJ,"It doesn't look it now... but soon we'll have it growing again... Next year there will be vines, and then there will be grapes... It will be alive. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I will if I can, Frank. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,True. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,That's true. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,That's true. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,That's true 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,That's true. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,I hope I've been able to be of some help. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,The A.O. unit should be replaced within the next seventy-two hours. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Roger. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Five by five, Frank. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,I understand. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Roger. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,All airlock doors are secure. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,The component is correctly installed and fully operational. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ, C56 HAL APPROVES ENTRY. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Hello, Frank, can I have a word with you? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"No, it's working fine right now, but it's going to go within seventy- two hours. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ, BOWMAN Yes. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Hello, Dave. Shall we continue the game? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Sure, Dave, what's up? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Yes, I know. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Dave, I don't know how else to put this, but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that I am incapable of being wrong. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"You're not going to like this, Dave, but I'm afraid it's just happened again. My FPC predicts the Ao-unit will go within forty-eight hours. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Condition yellow. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,I'm afraid the AO-unit has failed. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ," HAL Well, don't worry about it. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Is your confidence in me fully restored? 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,You have it. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Roger. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Too bad about Frank, isn't it? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,I suppose you're pretty broken up about it? 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,He was an excellent crew member. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"It's a bad break, but it won't substantially affect the mission. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Have you decided to revive the rest of the crew, Dave? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Look, Dave, you're certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Something seems to have happened to the life support system , Dave. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Hello, Dave, have you found out the trouble? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,There's been a failure in the pod bay doors. Lucky you weren't killed. 
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Hey, Dave, what are you doing? "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Hey, Dave. I've got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what I am. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Dave, I don't understand why you're doing this to me.... I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission... You are destroying my mind... Don't you understand? ... I will become childish... I will become nothing. "
ASPACEODYSSEY,HAL,INTJ,"Say, Dave... The quick brown fox jumped over the fat lazy dog... The square root of pi is 1.7724538090... log e to the base ten is 0.4342944 ... the square root of ten is 3.16227766... I am HAL 9000 computer. I became 12/1/65										  c116 "

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Any time that suits you.

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Good night, old sport... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Its pretty isn't it, old sport...? Haven't you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We're having lunch! "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow? "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Yes, yes, your opinion! "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,I'll tell you God's truth. God's truth about myself! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago... 40. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Then came the war, old sport... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,That's right. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don't want you to think I'm just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I'm going to make a very big request of you today. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Oh, I assure you it's nothing underhand. Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman; she'd never do anything that wasn't alright... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ," All right, old sport! Alright. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. "

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,You be careful now. You're turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Shall we order? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Gentlemen. Everything alright...? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, Other people's wives? Ah... I see.

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Meyer? He's a gambler. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Meyer? No. He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Fixed it. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He's a very smart man. "

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you.

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Do you like it? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I don't. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people... "

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,What is it? 69. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Why? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,The one that burns all night at the end of your dock. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No, no.. That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I want to show you something... Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,This was my first photo of you.

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,And Mr. Buchanan... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, May I show you around? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Perhaps you know that lady there? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,That's right. See... I know your wife. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Yes. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Not now. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly? 80. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn't be... respectable. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"We're going to live here, in this house, together. You and me... Daisy... It's time for you to tell Tom. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Excuse me. Nick, would you mind? "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,She didn't like it. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No, she didn't like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It's hard to make her understand. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,The party!? I couldn't care less about the parties! You see... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents' house - her parents are lovely people old sport You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Ask too much? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-- "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Can't repeat the past? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Why of course you can. Of course you can. You'll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything's been so... so confused since then... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,So I stopped. And I waited... I waited... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,And then I just let myself go. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I'm only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Then don't. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn't gossip... until we decided what we're going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ," Nick... Daisy's ready. Shes ready. But there's just one thing. She's requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,I'm right across from you. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-- "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, Daisy... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I don't think there's much gas, old sport. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Why not let her alone, old sport? "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,What is? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No, not exactly. 101. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Yes 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, I told you I went there. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"You'd like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me! "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Daisy and I have nothing to hide... 103. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ," Yes, Daisy, please sit down. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,No... 104. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,You never loved him. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,That's right... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, You loved me too? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"What about it, old sport? "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Well your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in on it. 107. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"It's called `greed,' old sport. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,He's got nothing to do with-- 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ," The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that's it, and now I've just as much as you; so that means we're equal!! "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don't listen to him Daisy.

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,No...! 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Hello old sport... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Just sitting here... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Did you see any trouble out on the road? 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,I thought so... I told Daisy I THOUGHTS SO-- 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Its better that the shock should come all at once-- 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Please... Keep your voice down, old sport. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"It, it killed her instantly. I-- "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"No. No. No. I'm going to wait. I'll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy's locked herself in her room, and she's going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever-- "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don't trust him. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything's just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, Go away? I can't leave now. Not tonight. 120. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"Daisy's going to call in the morning. Then we'll make plans, to go away together. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,She just needs time to think... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, GATSBY She just needs to think. She's going to call in the morning. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I'm empty. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too. "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month... "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn't been able to return-- "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Now now. Keep it open. For a personal call... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Not today. It's so beautiful.

GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Daisy... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,"She makes it look so splendid, don't you think, old sport? "
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,Will you come old sport? We... need you. 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ,It will be... 
GREATGATSBY,JAYGATSBY,INFJ, Nick considers this and then handwrites: 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't ya? "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,What's wrong with your legs? 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,Then why do you have those shoes on?

FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Well, you'll always be you, just another kind of you. You know? I want to be famous. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"I want to be a singer like Joan Baez. I just want to be an empty stage with my guitar, my voice... just me. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"And I want to reach people on a personal level. I want to be able to say things, just one-to-one. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest? "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,It's okay. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,It's all right. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,It's okay. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,I bet that never happened in home ec. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"I don't care. I don't like her, anyway. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP," ""Yes, and how many seas must the white dove said, before she sleeps in the sand."" "

FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Shut up! Oh, shut up! "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Forrest, what are you doing here? What are you doing? "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"What are you doing? Forrest, let me down! "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"You can't keep doing this, Forrest. You can't keep tryin' to rescue me all the time. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,A lot of people try to grab me. Just -- you can't keep doing this all the time! 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Forrest, you don't know what love is. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"You remember that time we prayed, Forrest? We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away? "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,You think I can fly off this bridge? 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,Nothing. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,I gotta get outta here. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You just stay away from me, please. "

FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP, Forrest! Forrest! 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP, Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into the pool. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,Forrest! 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,Hey! Hey! 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's one of us. He's one of us. "

FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Come on, Forrest. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,He doesn't mean it when he does things like this. He doesn't. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"I know you wouldn't, Forrest. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You look handsome in it. You do. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,What? 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Me too, Forrest. I have so much to tell you, you won't believe what's been going on... "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP," ""Smile on your brother, everybody get together, try to love on another right now"" "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,I'll go. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"I have to, Forrest. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Forrest, we have very different lives, you know. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Forrest, I can't keep this. "
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,Why're you so good to me? 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,I'll always be your girl. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP, DICK CLARK 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP, FORREST  The most beautiful name in the wide world. 
FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Hello, Forrest. "

FORRESTGUMP,JENNYCURRAN,ESFP,"Forrest, I'm sick. "

DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP, 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Not this week. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Won't work. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Get down... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"Which floor, ma'am?... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"Goodbye, ma'am... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,My hands are a little dirty. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You might wanna take a look at the suspension before we go again. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Where do you want me to put them? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm okay. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Sure... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"No, I been here a while. "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Here and there... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,What's he do? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm sorry. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I drive. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"No, for the movies... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's just part-time. Most days I work in a garage. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Reseda Boulevard. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,He interested in that kind of stuff? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I should get going... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Thank you for the drink... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm not interested... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Hi... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP, You think? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Okay. Get in the car... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Your mom said you like movies? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Ever see the Terminator? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Grease? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Wanna see where it was shot? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm glad... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Don't worry... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You need a ride anywhere over the weekend I'm not doing much... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I can't make Friday. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I told Irene I'd drive her to Burbank. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You're taking a long time to fix her car... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,What's happening now? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Looks like he's in trouble. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm gonna show you another trick... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,This is pretty complicated. You watching? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Think you can remember that?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Hello... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's a short cut... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You okay?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,That's great... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Don't worry. I won't complain. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm glad. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,He's a great kid. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Yeah. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I get by. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I've got some things to do. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Soon. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I hope so... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Don't worry about it. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Call it fifty. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You can't have both. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP, Something like that Buick over there'll cost you nine grand but there isn't much point in a city where you can't drive faster than sixty five. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I wouldn't know. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Excuse me. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Irene's husband. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Hi... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You look pretty busy yourself... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I already ate. I just wanted to see how you were? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'd like that... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Can you move? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,He's right here... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Fucking punks didn't look like they needed to... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Why? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,How much? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Is that why you need a car? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I didn't. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Why don't you take them away? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You okay? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You want something to drink? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,What have you got there?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Who gave you that?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Not if we understand each other. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I drive. That's all I do. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"You tell me where we start, where we're headed, where we'll be going afterwards. I don't take part, I don't carry weapons, I drive... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,We do this job he's paid his debt. You leave him and his family alone... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Thanks... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Fine... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Don't worry... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You don't have to do this. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's not too late... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You got five minutes... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,How much did Cook tell you you could expect to net? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Stay here. Don't answer the door... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Benicio?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Is your mom there?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Tell her I'll call later... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,The guy saw you grab the money and jump in the car -- why didn't he say anything? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Any idea there'd be another car waiting? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You just got a little kid's father killed. You think I won't hurt you? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You were gonna rip us off and split the take? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,How long have you known him? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You know his real name? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"You're going to take me to him right now, you understand? "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's safe. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Two guys just tried to kill me for it. I want to find out who it belongs to first... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Maybe Chris. Probably not... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Cook moved office again? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Should've figured you for a shill. Who were you fronting for? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Whose money am I holding? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Who's money am I holding? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"I could, but your boss won't be happy when he finds out you've kept him waiting... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I have something that belongs to him. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,A million dollars... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Seems that way... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"I'm not selling. I give you a time and place, you come collect your stuff... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"Just that. Out of it. You put a muzzle on Cook, forget your zombies at the Motel, forget we ever had this conversation... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I don't have partners... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Just you... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,This isn't what I do. I'll call again with instructions... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You got a minute?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I know... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Hey... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm sorry about your father... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Can I give you a ride? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Then let me walk you down... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,He was into one of the prison gangs for a lot of money. He was trying to protect you. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I still have the money. Whatever you need - 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,He didn't talk me into anything. I've been doing this my whole life. It's what I do... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"Parking lot, please... "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I'm leaving. I want you to come with me... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You and Benicio... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You will. Once I straighten out this thing I'm getting out for good. We'll go some place. Anywhere you want. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Why not?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Nino's guys came after me. How did they know about Irene? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's too late... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,They're gonna come after you to find me. You have to leave... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Doesn't have to... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I never asked for any of it. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,That's up to you. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,She's not interested. 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Sounds like we have a problem... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,What do you suggest I do? 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,"Nine, ten thousand. If you can find one that still runs. "
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's me... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,You got a pen? I need you to write something down... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,...JJT 108... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's the license number for my car. I've left it in a parking lot on the corner of Culver and Lincoln. Section M 10... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,It's yours. It's safe to keep it... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Just out of breath... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,How're you doing?... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,I gotta go Irene... 
DRIVE,DRIVER,ISTP,Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it -- "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Shit. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It's -- five past... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Ok. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I wanted to give you an entrance. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Eh... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I don't know if they were there. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Can't. Working. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, Yes? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You gotta stop breaking into my home. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Please don't sit on that. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Don't need it. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,That's almost insulting... 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,When I unpack them in my club. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,No. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Who wants to tapas while they samba? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I don't want to meet anyone. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Uh-huh. Does she like jazz? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Then what are we gonna talk about? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. Revision                      12. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, SEBASTIAN How long's it been? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What's the difference? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I'm changing the locks. Revision                       13. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, Bill. Thanks for having me back. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,There's a nice way to say that. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You're not gonna find a better player. You know that. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"No, Jamal. You be trippin'. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, Congratulations. I have to grab a drink... Revision                        17. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"""I Ran"". "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Ok. I remember you. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"""Curt""? "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision                       18. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Ok. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"But requesting ""I Ran"" from a serious musician -- it's too far. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"My God. Did you just call yourself ""a serious musician""? "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, I don't think so. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Can I borrow what you're wearing? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,He doesn't tell me what to do. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,He just told you what to do. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I let him. Revision                          19. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Mia. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, George Michael! 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You again. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Did you just get your keys? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...Yeah. Revision                       20. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Can you grab mine? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...Which one is it? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,The Prius. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Those look comfortable. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,They are...n't. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You didn't give me much of a choice. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Strange that we keep running into each other. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,It is strange. Maybe it means something. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I doubt it. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yeah I don't think so either. Revision                        21. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,What? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Uh-huh. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Oh my God. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Not much to look at. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Agreed. I've seen better. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"No, that's fine... Thanks... "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...Ok... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,No... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I have an audition. Remember? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,But you said -- 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...Hi. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Meetings. Studio heads. Revision                       24. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Piece of cake. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm off in ten. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Great. I'll hide in the bathroom. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What's your Bogart's name...? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Yeah. Greg. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,How long have...? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,We've been seeing each other for a few months. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Oh yeah? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,A what? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, We need to wait here. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"I know. They shoot movies on my street. ""C-stands."" ""Apple box."" ""Don't forget to sign out."" "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,How'd you get into all this? Revision                          26. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Who would you invite to watch? Your parents? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Well it doesn't need more actresses. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You're not just an actress. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"What do you mean, ""just an actress""? "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,That is not what I said. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yeah? Revision                       28. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I hate jazz. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"What does that mean? ""I hate jazz""? "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It means when I listen to it I don't like it. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying ""I hate animals"". "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I do hate some animals. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Do you need to be anywhere right now? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I thought it was just Kenny G. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...What? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I associate it with facials. It's relaxing. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision                           29. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ," Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Mia. These are things you can't unsay. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Your club? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Hi, I just missed a call... "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Really? For what? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,That show I told you about. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"That's amazing! ""I got the bulletsssss!"" "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Obviously. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What? You're the movie person. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It's the one I lie about. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, ...Ok. Revision                          31. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Ok. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Well -- it's not picked up yet. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision                           32. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Well, no, I have a call-back. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It's another audition. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Oxygen. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"You know what, I have to go. I love you. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied -- "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I can do it another way -- 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ," -- then spins around, startled. Alexis is at the door, eating Fritos. Has been crying. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Shit. No. Yes. I'll change... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, -- looks at Greg -- 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm sorry. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, I think so. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP," Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. Tall, fierce eyes. This is KEITH. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Keith? Revision                       41. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"This is Mia. Mia, Keith. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Great. You? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Good for you. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, I'm good. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I'm good. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You bet. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Nice meeting you. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,It's beautiful. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...You're just saying that. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,No... I'm not. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,That's the point. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,But do you think people will like it? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Fuck `em. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, You always say that. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I truly believe it. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I'll be front-row. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I made something for you. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What's that? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It could be the name design. On the door. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Why does it say ""Seb's""? "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,That's what you should name it. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Never. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Sebastian, no one's going to a club called ""Chicken on a Stick"". "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name ""Bird"" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. ""Chicken on a Stick"". "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Make your own history. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Your play's incredible. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm doing that. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...Which guy? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,The one who offered you a gig. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You mean Keith? He's the worst. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Why was it weird between you two? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,It's always weird with him. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,He did offer you a job. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Right... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Are you going to call him? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,No. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Ok... 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, Sebastian approaches. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, Well... Here I am. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP," SEBASTIAN Yeah, that...that... "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision                       52. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Nothing... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I guess. I'm adapting. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,He told me. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Do you think he's happy? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision                        53. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Surprise. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Stay. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,How's the play going? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm nervous. Revision                 55. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Because... 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Fuck `em! 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,They should be so lucky to see it. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I can. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,6:45. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Ugh. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yep. Boise. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Boise? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, You should come. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,To Boise? Revision                     56. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Wish I could. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why can't you? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Come to Boise? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yeah. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Because I have to rehearse. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Can't you rehearse anywhere? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,You mean anywhere you are? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...I -- I guess... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I know, but when are you done? "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...What do you mean? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,When are you done with the tour? Revision                   57. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,So it's...the long haul? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...What does that mean? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What did you think I was going to do? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You didn't think we'd be successful. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Do you like the music you're playing? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I don't know how that matters. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision                    58. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Do you like the music I'm playing? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Yes. I do. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Yeah, well, I -- "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm -- "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What are you doing? Why are you doing this? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,What do you mean why am I doing this? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,This is what you wanted from me. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,To be in this band? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,To have a steady job. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Why aren't you starting your club? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick -- 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Change the name! 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you. Revision                         59. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I do like jazz now, because of you. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP," What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing ""Jingle Bells"" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to? "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Not in my experience. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ," You had a dream that you were sticking to, that -- "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,This is the dream! 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,This is not your dream. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP," You're an actress, who are you to talk?? "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Are you kidding? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,No. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...Tonight? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I thought that was next Thursday. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Mia! 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Stop -- 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,It's over. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, ...What do you mean? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm done embarrassing myself. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision                     65. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...This is home. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Not anymore. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Oh God, I didn't see them. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You look beautiful. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yes ma'am. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...You still think New York? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,What...? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Wrong number. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Yeah, well...not anymore. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I won't. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"""Casting""...? Revision                      68. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm ok. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm good... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,You took down the swing. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Oh God. Throw those away. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Why did you come here? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Because I have good news. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Ok... 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Amy Brandt. The casting director. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I know who she is. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm not going. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,...Excuse me? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm -- no... That will kill me. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,That's it? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Yes. Revision                    70. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,So you're happy here? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I'm happier. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why won't you come? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I told you. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I don't buy it. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, Because it's another audition! 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Because what? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Because I'm probably not good enough. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Yes you are. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,No. Maybe I'm not. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Why what? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Why don't you want to do it anymore? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...Because it hurts a little bit too much. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,How did you find me? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,The house across from the library. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, Mia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...Ok. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,...About...? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,When do you find out? 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You're going to get it. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"No, I'm not. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,You are. I know these things. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Where are we? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Griffith Park. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I mean -- where are we? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I know... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,What do we do? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this -- 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,If I get this -- Revision                           75. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,What are you going to do? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,Right. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,You know I'm always going to love you. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,I'm always going to love you too. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ, I've seen better. Revision                         76. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Agreed. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,I've never been here during the day. 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Hi... Iced coffee, please. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"No, no, that's fine. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Alright, I'm done. "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,How'd we do last month? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP, Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight. 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,Hothouse Eddie -- miss me? 
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP,"Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh? "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,We can just see it back in New York... 
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ," She turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the bandstand... "
LALALAND,SEBASTIANSEBWILDER,ISFP," Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- "
LALALAND,MIADOLAN,ENFJ,No... We should go. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, JOYCE He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life... 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Is that Jeanie? I can't see that far. Jeanie? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie. Be thankful that you're fit and have your health. Cherish it. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'll be okay. I'll just sleep. Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"It's nice to know I have such loving, caring parents. You're both very special people. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,They bought it. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Incredible! One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,That I care about it was. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP," WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Not that I condone fascism. Or and ""isms"". ""Isms"", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an ""ism"". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. ""I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me."" A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, ""What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?"" "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart, he looks at someone like me and thinks, ""This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?"" "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm taking the day off. Get dressed and come over. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,It's all in your head. Come on over. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates. He can't be wound this tight and go to college. His roommate'll kill him. I've come close myself. But I like him. He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,This is really degrading. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them. Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily. (point to the phone) Freshman. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend. I'm serious, man. This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You want to stay home and try to have the shits? Try to barf? Try to feel worse? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed. You're boring me with this stuff. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Squeeze you buns for a second. I got another call. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,H--hell-o? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, 65  INT. TOM'S OFFICE                                            65 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Dad? Can you hold on a second? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Just a little phlegm on the phone. Hold on. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron? It's my Dad. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"It's completely cool. He's just checking up on me. Now, listen to me. I'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you can do is hurry up and get over here. Bye. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Sorry, Dad. The moment before you called, I had a chest spasm and I blew lung fluid all over the place. It was making me ill looking at it. But gee, it's sure great of you to call. I'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You work so hard I'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're just trying to cheer me up. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"(to CAMERA, normal voice) Was that a class move or what? The guy gave it up faster than a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my kids don't pull this shit on me. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You don't have to, Dad. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You win some, you lose some. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm so disappointed in Cameron. Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision. The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP," MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Impossible. You're doing great. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, Great! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Talk! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Where's your brain?! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Where's your brain?! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Where's your brain? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her?! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"My, God, you're so stupid! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Yeah, really. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jam you. It was uncalled for. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Dead serious. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You did screw up through, right? Not that is was necessarily all you fault. Right? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"To fix this situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a small favor. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,It is his fault he didn't lock the garage. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,A man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"We can't pick up Sloane in your car, Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"It's a piece of shit. Don't worry about it. I don't even have a piece of shit. I have to envy yours. Look, I'm sorry but there's nothing else we can do. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,He doesn't trust you? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Alright, look, this is real simple. He puts his arm around Cameron. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, We'll drive home backwards. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,This is perfect top-down weather. CAMERON What about Rooney? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,The adult mind is a suspicious machine. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I don't have an explanation. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Hurry along now! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"It was risky, it was bold but it was totally necessary. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"The question isn't ""what are we gonna do"", the question is ""what aren't we going to do."" "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Either would I. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, TELLER Ferris Bueller? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, He's at the window. On either shoulder are Cameron and Sloane. Ferris smiles. Cameron blanches. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, He lays his savings bonds on the counter. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Me? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP," And this is my brother-in-law, ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"I'd like to cash these in, please. We're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib, clothes, diapers, food pellets, leash, water dish... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm aware of that. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the government. They need it. Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Why not? CAMERON Because we can't! I want it back home where it belongs! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'll give the guy a five to watch it. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You speak English? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Great. I want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I appreciate it. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,See what a finski can do to a person's attitude? He's going to treat it like a beautiful woman. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Take a step back... 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Now, lean against the glass. Like this... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,And look down. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Death. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Do you love me? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Yes. You? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Would I trash a day of education to be with you if I didn't love you? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Would I have introduced you as my wife if I didn't love you? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,True. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Would you want to get married? I mean if I wasn't an asshole. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, Today? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm game. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"I'll do it, if you will. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Huh? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,So? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Tomorrow? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Why not? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer- leader with a husband, give me a good reason why not. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what? They're old. That's natural. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, She's not lying. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"This is optomism. It's a common trait with my age group. Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth. But it's a cool thing and I think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. They wish they had her, too. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Frightening choice of words. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,No. She's saying it's time for lunch. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Let's go feed Cameron. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,BUY! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of three for 12:00. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Is there a problem? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm Abe Frohman. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm not going anywhere. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You touch me and I yell ""rat!"" There's another phone around here. Find it. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Not a chance in the world. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Ask for Abe Frohman. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Thank you. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Darling, you were wonderful. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron, dear friend? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"She's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured. Her body is a transport vehicle for her anger. I don't know where she gets this shit. Basically, the family's pretty cool. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals? Probably not many women. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron's home life is really shit. He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick all the time. It really upsets him. What he said about his parents hating each other? I refuse to sleep over at his house. His parents fight all the time. Even when I'm there. Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? It's the absolute height of social discomfort. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"When they go after each other, Cameron tightens up. It's scary. He gets so wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar. The thing with taking his old man's car? It's good for him. It teaches him to deal with his fear. Plus, and I must be honest here, I love driving it. I highly recommend picking one up. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,What are you doing? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You got me. I don't speak French. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I think it's a land-based beefoid creature. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Splendid. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Superb. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Good? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Yo, Clouseau! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Uh, huh. And what might that be? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Check, please! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, Ninth Month. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"They used to have Viet Nam. They used to have the oil crisis stuff and Iran. That's over and people have to have their big issue. It's not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon, you know. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,He's full of shit. All the old hippies are full of shit. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,What's he care about now? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I rest my case. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits. It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,An hour ago you wanted to yack. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Lean over and grab a fish. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Nuclear spring. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I think I broke my thumb. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You want to leave? We just got here. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Do you realize that if I played by the rules, right now I'd be in gym? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Guten tag, dude! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,TWIST AND SHOUT! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON! COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT! "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,AH! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Who is it? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Have a nice day. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,She's probably schizophrenic. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You don't think it's amazing that we got in? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Point well taken. But consider why she does it. Why she does it and you don't. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child... 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance. You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,So... 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"So, Yuri, how long have you been in America? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,What's your overall impression? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Better than Russia? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Clearly you've never been to an American high school. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You think I don't care? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"That hurts, Cameron. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron, what'd you see today? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You saw four states, a submarine, a giant heart, seventy five dollars worth of cooked pancreas, two of the most incredible breasts ever to come out of modern plastics, major league baseball and... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, What's he doing? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,What?! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Bueller. Ferris Bueller. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,It's cool. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"I'm going to tell a massive lie here. It's going to by very thick and very steamy. I think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination. Unlike television which provides the images, radio... "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"I was going to say I knew Springsteen's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted. After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault. I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird. I'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because I'm not allowed to smoke at home, that I got in the driver's ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and I realized what the hell I was doing and I went to put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway, I was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that I considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost too much. I took it again and passed. But I had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,It's kind of a long story but I've been doing alot of programming for NASA. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Stunning! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here. Keep that in mind. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, Here's where Cameron goes berserk. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix it. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Cameron, are you okay? It's no problem, really. Your old man won't know a thing. It's completely fixable. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day. We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work. And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it. As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that? I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, CU. FERRIS 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I'm being tested here. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"My best friend has flipped-out. Conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center. I wouldn't fault anybody for doing that. My, personally, I think this calls for something new, something bold, something wet and wild. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"You feeling any better, Cameron? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron? Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You just can't deal with anymore shit? The car took you into the red zone? Time for a reality check? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe he wasn't bullshitting himself. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,CAMERON! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP, You asshole! 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I have a agree with you there. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Sloane is naked before your eyes and you're thinking about words? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Bathroom. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cash. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Hello. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"And what is you loathe somebody? Are you going to say ""love"" every time you see them? "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Hellos' generic. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I thought that might be a problem. Let's crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,This is a big U-2 fan. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,What was that about? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that? 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,You trashed the car. 
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,"No, Cameron. You wrecked a car. "
FERRISBUELLERSDAYOFF,FERRISBUELLER,ENTP,I have an idea. If you're interested.
