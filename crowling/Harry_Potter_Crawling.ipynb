      "[<i>[It is nighttime in Surrey, we see an owl on the street sign \"PRIVET DRIVE\" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. The owl flies away and an elderly man with crimson robes and a long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks out of a forest near the street, past a tabby cat standing next to what looks like a shed. He takes out his deluminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat.]</i>, <i>[The cat silently looks at him, and the camera turns towards a wall. The cat's shadow turns into a woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGonagall is revealed.]</i>, <i>[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid takes off his goggles.]</i>, <i>[Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.]</i>, <i>[They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.]</i>, <i>[Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat.]</i>, <i>[Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door.]</i>, <i>[The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.]</i>, <i>[The scar's glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs]</i>, <i>[She knocks on his closet door repeatedly]</i>, <i>[Smacks door of closet and walks into the living room]</i>, <i>[Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet.

      "Hagrid: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.\n",
      "Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah.\n",
      "27 Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n",
      "Vernon:  He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!\n",
      "Harry: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?\n",
      "Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you.\n",
      "Harry:  Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!\n",
      "Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?\n",
      "Petunia: We had to tell him something.\n",
      "Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!\n",
      "28 Vernon: He'll not be going!\n",
      "Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?\n",
      "Harry: Muggle?\n",
      "Hagrid:  Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world,  he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "29 Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!\n",
      "30 Hagrid: Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me.\n",
      "31 Dudley: Ahh!\n",
      "32 Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.\n",
      "Harry:  Okay.\n",
      "Hagrid:  Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?\n",
      "33 Harry:  First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand. \n",
      "Hagrid: Essential bit of equipment, Harry.\n",
      "Harry: One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon.\n",
      "Harry: But you like a dragon?\n",
      "Hagrid: Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood. \n",
      "34 Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?\n",
      "Hagrid: If you know where to go.\n",
      "35 Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?\n",
      "Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.\n",
      "Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.\n",
      "36 Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\n",
      "37 Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\n",
      "38 Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.\n",
      "Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.\n",
      "Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. \n",
      "Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.\n",
      "Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.\n",
      "Harry: Goodbye.\n",
      "39 Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!\n",
      "Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?\n",
      "Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.\n",
      "40 Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet. \n",
      "41 Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.\n",
      "42 \n",
      "Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?\n",
      "Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.\n",
      "43 Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?\n",
      "Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which.\n",
      "Goblin: Very well.\n",
      "44 Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please.\n",
      "45 Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?\n",
      "46 Griphook: Vault 713.\n",
      "Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?\n",
      "Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.\n",
      "Griphook: Stand back. \n",
      "Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.\n",
      "47 Harry: I still need...a wand.\n",
      "Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.\n",
      "48 Harry:  Hello? Hello?\n",
      "49 Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious.\n",
      "Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?\n",
      "Ollivander:  I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. \n",
      "Harry: And...who owned that wand?\n",
      "Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. \n",
      "50 Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! \n",
      "Harry:  Wow.\n",
      "51 Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.\n",
      "Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.\n",
      "Hagrid:  First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...\n",
      "Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?\n",
      "Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort.\n",
      "Harry: Voldemort?\n",
      "Hagrid: Shh!!\n",
      "52 Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you.\n",
      "53 Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?\n",
      "Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.\n",
      "Harry: What happened to...to You-Know-Who?\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.\n",
      "54 Hagrid: What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.\n",
      "55 Harry: Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there? \n",
      "56 Man: Sorry.\n",
      "57 Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.\n",
      "Guard: Right on your left, ma'am.\n",
      "Harry: Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?\n",
      "Guard:  9¾? Think you're being funny, do ya? \n",
      "58 Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.\n",
      "Harry: Muggles?\n",
      "Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.\n",
      "59 Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.\n",
      "George: He's not Fred, I am!\n",
      "Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother.\n",
      "Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.\n",
      "60 Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. \n",
      "Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-\n",
      "Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\n",
      "Ginny: Good luck.\n",
      "61 Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.\n",
      "Harry: No, not at all.\n",
      "Ron:  I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.\n",
      "Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.\n",
      "62 Ron: So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the...\n",
      "Harry: The what?\n",
      "Ron:  Scar...?\n",
      "Harry: Oh \n",
      "Ron: Wicked.\n",
      "63 Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?\n",
      "Ron:  No, thanks, I'm all set. \n",
      "Harry: We'll take the lot! \n",
      "Ron: Whoa!\n",
      "64 Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?\n",
      "Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!\n",
      "65 Harry:  These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?\n",
      "Ron: It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.\n",
      "Harry:  I got Dumbledore!\n",
      "Ron: I got about 6 of him.\n",
      "66 Harry: Hey, he's gone!\n",
      "Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?\n",
      "Harry: A little.\n",
      "Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?\n",
      "Harry: Yeah!\n",
      "Ron:  Ahem. Sun-\n",
      "67 Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.\n",
      "Ron: No.\n",
      "Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.\n",
      "Ron:  Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!\n",
      "68 Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?\n",
      "Ron:  I'm...Ron Weasley. ..\n",
      "Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. \n",
      "69 Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!\n",
      "70 Hagrid: Hello, Harry.\n",
      "Harry: Hey, Hagrid.\n",
      "Ron: Whoaa!\n",
      "Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.\n",
      "71 Ron: Wicked.\n",
      "72 McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.\n",
      "73 Neville: Trevor!  Sorry. \n",
      "McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. \n",
      "74 Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. \n",
      "Harry:  I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.\n",
      "75 McGonagall: We're ready for you now. Follow me.\n",
      "76 Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.\n",
      "77 McGonagall: Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.\n",
      "78 Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.\n",
      "McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.\n",
      "Hermione:  Oh, no. Okay, relax. \n",
      "Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.\n",
      "79 Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!\n",

      "85 McGonagall: Harry Potter.\n",
      "86 Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?\n",
      "Harry:  Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.\n",
      "Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It’s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?\n",
      "Harry  Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.\n",
      "Sorting Hat: Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!\n",

      "Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.\n",
      "Harry: What's he teach?\n",
      "Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.\n",

      "99 Ron: That was bloody brilliant.\n",
      "McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time.\n",
      "Harry: We got lost.\n",
      "McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.\n",
      "100 Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? \n",
      "Harry: I don't know, sir.\n",
      "Snape: And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?\n",
      "Harry: I don't know, sir.\n",

      "101 Harry: Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her.\n",
      "102 Snape: Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's . \n",

Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.\n",

      "207 Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.\n",
      "Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?\n",
      "Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.\n",
      "Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!\n",
      "Harry: What?\n",
      "Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.\n",
      "Harry: Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?\n",
      "Hermione:  Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.\n",
      "Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! \n",
      "Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?\n",
      "Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...\n",
      "Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?\n",
      "Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.\n",
      "208 Hermione: Is that...a dragon?\n",
      "Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.\n",
      "Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.\n",
      "209 Harry: Norbert?\n",
      "Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede.\n",
      "210 Hagrid: Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that? \n",
      "Harry: Malfoy.\n",
      "Hagrid: Oh, dear.\n",
      "211 Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.\n",
      "Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.\n",
      "Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?\n",
      "Ron: It's bad.\n",
      "212 McGonagall: Good evening.\n",
      "213 McGonagall:  Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.\n",
      "Harry: 50?!\n",
      "McGonagall: Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.\n",
      "214 Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...\"the four of us.\"\n",
      "McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.\n",
      "215 Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?\n",
      "Hagrid:  Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.\n",
      "Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.\n",
      "Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.\n",
      "Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.\n",
      "Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!\n",
      "Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night. \n",
      "Hagrid: Right. Let's go.\n",
      "216 Harry: Hagrid, what's that?\n",
      "Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.\n",
      "Ron: Okay.\n",
      "Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. \n",
      "Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!\n",
      "Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. \n",
      "217 Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.\n",
      "Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.\n",
      "Draco: Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.\n",
      "218 Harry: What is it, Fang?\n",
      "219 Draco: HELP!!!!!\n",
      "220 Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.\n",
      "Harry: But what was that thing you saved me from?\n",
      "Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.\n",
      "Harry: But who would choose such a life?\n",
      "Firenze: Can you think of no one?\n",
      "Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?\n",
      "Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\n",
      "Harry:  The Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "221 Hermione: Harry!\n",
      "Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? \n",
      "Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.\n",
      "222 Hermione:  You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?\n",
      "Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.\n",
      "Ron: But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?\n",
      "Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.\n",
      "Ron:  And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.\n",
      "Hermione: Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione: I'd always heard Hogwart’s end-of-year exams were frightful, but I’ve found they're rather enjoyable.\n",
      "Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.\n",
      "Hermione: It's happened before...\n",
      "Harry: Not like this.\n",
      "Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.\n",
      "Harry: I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming.  Ah... Oh! Of course!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione: What is it?\n",
      "Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry: Hagrid,  who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like?\n",
      "Hagrid: I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.\n",
      "Harry: This stranger though, you and he must have talked.\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, he- he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him, I said, after Fluffy a dragon's gonna be no problem.\n",
      "Harry: Did he seem interested in Fluffy?\n",
      "Hagrid: Well, o’ course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told ‘im, I said, I said, ‘The trick with any beast is to know how to calm ‘im. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit o’ music, and he falls straight to sleep.’ I shouldn't have told you that.  Where are you going? Where are you-?\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!\n",
      "McGonagall: I’m afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.\n",
      "Harry: He’s gone! Now! But, this is important! This is about the Philosophers Stone!\n",
      "McGonagall:  How do you know-?\n",
      "Harry: Someone’s going to try to steal it!\n",
      "McGonagall: I don’t know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is perfectly well protected. Now, would you go back to your dormitories, quietly\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means, he knows how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone-\n",
      "Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors, such as yourselves, be doing inside on a day like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione: Ah, w- w- w... we- we were just-\n",
      "Snape: You ought to be careful. People will think you’re... up to something. \n",
      "Hermione: Now, what do we do?\n",
      "Harry:  We go down the trap door, tonight.\n",
      "223 [The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.]\n",
      "224 Harry: You? [Quirrell turns to face him] No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-\n",
      "Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?\n",
      "Harry: But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.\n",
      "Quirrell: [smiling evilly] No, dear boy. I tried to kill you. [Harry eyes him in disbelief and confusion] And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.\n",
      "Harry: Snape was trying to save me?\n",
      "Quirrell: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.\n",
      "Harry: Then-then you let the troll in.\n",
      "Quirrell: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. [he turns towards the mirror again; Harry winces as his scar burns again] He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never. [staring into the mirror] Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: Use the boy. [Harry looks around, wondering where the voice is coming from]\n",
      "Quirrell: [turns to Harry] Come here, Potter. Now! [Harry slowly walks down the stairs, towards Quirrell and the mirror] Tell me... what do you see? [Harry looks into the mirror, and for a few seconds, sees him standing next to Quirrell, then his reflection reaches into its pocket and pulls out a gleaming red ruby, the Philosopher’s Stone; Harry stares in amazement as his reflection smiles and winks, then puts the stone back in its pocket; Harry feels his pocket and realizes the Stone really is in his pocket, then looks up again] What is it? [glances at Harry while speaking] What do you see?\n",
      "Harry: [looks at Quirrell, then back at the mirror, determined not to let Quirrell know that he has the Stone] I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: He lies.\n",
      "Quirrell: [angrily shouting] Tell the truth! What do you see?!\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: Let me speak to him.\n",
      "Quirrell: [as Harry backs away] Master, you are not strong enough.\n",
      "Unseen Inhuman Voice: I have strength enough for this.\n",
      "[Quirrell reaches up and starts unwrapping his turban as he turns so his back is to the mirror. Harry turns toward the staircase into the room, wondering whether he should try to escape, then turns towards Quirrell again. He is almost finished unwrapping his turban, save for a piece covering the back of his head. Finally, he removes the turban, revealing a scary-looking chalk white face, Voldemort. He cranes around and opens his eyes.]\n",
      "Voldemort: Harry Potter, we meet again.\n",
      "Harry: [realizing his identity] Voldemort.\n",
      "Voldemort: Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [realizing Voldemort is referring to the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry turns and runs back up the stairs]\n",
      "225 Voldemort: Stop him. [Quirrell snaps his fingers, instantly causing fire walls to block all the exits, trapping Harry in the room] Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?\n",
      "Harry: [shakes his head] Never!\n",
      "Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. [In the mirror, Harry's parents appear in the reflection.] All I ask for is something in return. [Harry takes the Stone from his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! [James and Lily Potter fade from the reflection]\n",
      "Harry: You liar!\n",
      "Voldemort: Kill him!\n",
      "226 Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! [He backs up away from Harry. His hand is crumbling into ash and dust.] What is this magic? [His hand disintegrates]\n",
      "Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!\n",
      "227 Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?\n",
      "Harry: Admirers?\n",
      "Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. [They both smile.] Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.\n",
      "Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.\n",
      "Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.\n",
      "Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?\n",
      "Dumbledore: [sits on the bed.] He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.\n",
      "Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...\n",
      "Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.\n",
      "Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head.] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.\n",
      "Harry: What is it?\n",
      "Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. [Pats Harry's head gently and stands up.] Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...[takes brown bean and eats it.] Mm. Alas. Earwax.\n",
      "228 Harry: All right there, Ron?\n",
      "Ron: All right? You?\n",
      "Harry: [as he shrugs] All right. Hermione?\n",
      "Hermione: [smiling] Never better.\n",
      "229 Dumbledore: Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points! [There is a medium applause from the crowd.] In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points! [The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.] Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points! [Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.] And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house! [A loud roar rises from the Slytherin table, as students stand up and clap for themselves. Hermione scowls with her hand to her cheek; Snape applauds the students of his house]\n",
      "Draco: Nice one, mate. [sneers at Ron]\n",
      "230 Harry: [giving Hermione a pat on the back] Good job. [Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle don't like what's happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.]\n",
      "231 [The Gryffindors cheer again, this time even louder than before. Malfoy has a cringing look on his face, while Harry sees a proud, smiling professor McGonagall at the teacher's table. Hermione, who has done some quick math, whispers to her fellow students.]\n",
      "Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!\n",
      "[Now, the Gryffindors look really hopeful, as Dumbledore hasn't finished talking yet.]\n",
      "Dumbledore: And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom! [Neville can't believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione's whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order! [He claps and motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol] Gryffindor wins the House Cup!\n",
      "[The Great Hall explodes with applause, not only from the Gryffindors, but also from the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs, because they are glad that, for the first time in seven years, someone other than Slytherin has won the House Cup. Hagrid can't help himself to also cheer, and all students except the Slytherins throw their hats in the air, while Malfoy angrily throws his on the table in defeat. The Gryffindors around Harry are all congratulating him and Harry smiles to Hagrid, who smiles back.]\n"
