I've watched it hundreds of times and never get bored of this masterpeice.</p><hr><p><b>Tilly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>BEST MOVIE THAT WAS EVER CREATED! Though it's completely weird the first time you watch it and you are confused, the second time you watch it you'll get up and dance and time-warp with your onscreen trannnies, maids, doctors, and Meatloaf! 

BLEOW!</p><hr><p><b>Maggie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw it first last halloween and fell in love with it. I knew a few of the songs, and my friend was staring at me when I somehow sang along (accurately too) to some of the songs I never even heard before. Did the Time Warp, threw rice, yelled 'asshole!' and 'slut!' Mm..</p><hr><p><b>Karin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's just great! I'm a totally frankie fan :D
</p><hr><p><b>Caitlyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really like Columbia and Janet. I really like doing the Time Warp again and again. My mom (yes I said mom!) got me hooked! When she was a teenager she apparently snuck out and saw it over and over at the midnight dollar movies lol.</p><hr><p><b>Ashlyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was just strange. But it wasn't just one of those movies that you think, "okay, this is just too weird to keep watching". You actually WANT to keep watching it... over and over again. And that oh so memorable line, "Let's do the time warp again" will almost guaranteed stick in your mind. Definitely something worth buying.</p><hr><p><b>Marianne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There's no better film. IT'S THE BEST MOVIE EVER and it's funny to watch people see Frankenfurter for the first time. My dad showed it to me, then my friend got me the soundtrack. I'M OBSESSED! Let's do the timewarp again and again and again! By the way, whatever did happen to Fay Wray?</p><hr><p><b>Dylan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There is no actual number I could really rate this since it was the best movie ever created in all of movie history. This was the first movie I had ever saw and it was my favorite since then. Magenta is my favorite along with Frank, of course. I would go back in time to do the Time Warp over and over. If you don't love this movie you are CRAZY!</p><hr><p><b>Rebecca</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i love this movie, it is one of my all time favorites. I really like Magenta and Riff Raff and of course there's Frank. I wish I could do the timewarp again and again.</p><hr><p><b>Valeria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey! This is MY movie! I'm a great fan of it in Italy, where I live. I'm in the cast of the The Rocky Horror House, I play the Transylvanian. It's great!</p><hr><p><b>Tessa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The greatest musical of ALL time. It's fun, sexy and has the most catching songs!</p><hr><p><b>Carlene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have ever seen! The cast is amazing and the music is so catchy. I am always singing it! It's so funny and sexy, just the perfect flim!</p><hr><p><b>Liz Black</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite movie of all time. You must watch it!</p><hr><p><b>joanne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best. I know all the words and songs, it's excellent.</p><hr><p><b>Danielle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have ever seen and I really like to watch it in the play where they act it out while they play the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Jaymi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. The cast is really talented.</p><hr><p><b>Vicky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really loved the show when I went to see it at the theatre. It was great! Now myself and a few others have got to learn it; we're performing a show. Help!</p><hr><p><b>cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really liked the show; I thought that it was really funny!</p><hr><p><b>Rory</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Should become The Eighth Wonder of the World. Best movie in existance. Let's hope it's popularity goes on through the ages.</p><hr><p><b>Riff Raff</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well Hello Earthlings. It is me. I am here to destroy EVERYTHING! My Most Beautiful sistah, Magenter is right beside me "and soon we shall return to our moon drenched shores of our beloved planet and take that step to the right.".</p><hr><p><b>karissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie so much that I went out and I bought it. It was so funny and really weird at the same time and ya so that's all I really have to say about this.</p><hr><p><b>Arthur Phillips</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever? You need to grow up.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the greatest works of art in all time.</p><hr><p><b>Nate Summers</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Yeah, I have to agree with Mr. Phillips. This is NO WHERE near the best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Magenta</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My friend made me watch this one day and I was so totally disgusted and disturbed I went out and bought it. I have been obsessed ever since

definately the eighth wonder of the world, a must watch.</p><hr><p><b>Sean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Greatest movie ever, but why is the script on this webpage so different than in the movie. Some of the dialog isn't the same and the part were they turn everyone into the statues it says that Frank goes over and lays on the medical bed (or something) and magenta rubs his temples but he actually goes up against the wall and magenta doesn't even touch him?</p><hr><p><b>Alissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It really is the best, although seeing the movie at home can't even compare to a movie theater with callbacks and performers.</p><hr><p><b>merle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It can never be re-created though, because it's perfect the way it is. So I hope no one tries to re-do it. There's no shot in hell that it would be anywhere near as good.</p><hr><p><b>maxeen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No doubt the greatest musical/movie ever made! We did this musical in my high school in ohio I played the role of janet and my boyfriend now husband played rocky. It was amazing! Pure genius.</p><hr><p><b>Random Guy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I watched this when I was 5 and 11 years later I still watch it at least once a month. I'm hooked. I'm going to see it being done as a play soon hopefully. I've already got all the costume. This is a pure genius film and anyone who doesn't like this is crazier than me, and I should be in an institute.</p><hr><p><b>Secluded</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hilarious, mind-boggling, and much, much more amusing to see in a theater. What other movie has spawned so much excitement and such a vibrant following as this? Added note to Mr. Summers: Nowhere is, in fact, a single word that needn't be broken down into two. Granted, there are many people who don't find Rocky Horror to be the greatest movie ever made, and many who do not appreciate the movie at all, and I'm sure we all appreciate that peoples tastes differ, and that having your own opinion is a marvelous thing, but both you and Mr Phillips must learn that telling the fans that they "need to grow up" is insulting and uncalled for. If anything, by using that term of phrase, it proves that it is you both who need do grow up.</p><hr><p><b>Ciara</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I mean, I love Rocky as much as the next whore, but I don't think it's the BEST movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Max Manfre</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>How I feel about this movie is undescribable. The movie is ridiculously funny. I've got to hand to Tim Curry, he's got a lot of balls to dress up as a sweet transvestite. Tim Curry is one of the best actors of all time. Susan Surandon and Little Nell were two exceptional beauties. This is one film I get never get bored watching. Tim Curry kicks ass! </p><hr><p><b>Petfauna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever! I have been a Groupie since 1982! I have seen RHPS over 1,000 times. I own several copies on VSH and DVD. We have our own RHPS nights right here at home. We get to throw rice and hot dogs and toast, we get to light up our lighters and squirt our water guns in all the right places and no one tells us we have to leave! (after the movie, we all pitch in and clean up so there is no mess for one person to deal with) For those of you who said, grow up... you need to lighten up!</p><hr><p><b>kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this move. Frank-N-Furter is my favorite character, no doubt. I can't stop singing "Sweet Transvestite" now! I was so upset when Frank died. I am still have the deepest love ever for Frank, even if he is a transvestite. Tim Curry did an amazing job, and continued to do an amazing job when he played Rooster in Annie. I also keep singing "Touch-a Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me". If you did not see this movie, you do not know what you're missing. This is a five star movie, and if you don't enjoy watching fun-filled, cool and crazy musicals, then this is not the movie for you, because the Rocky Horror Picture Show promises a good time.</p><hr><p><b>Fraz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>By far my favourite movie. I've just discovered this site, I've read a few films I know well, and they're all slightly different, with added scenes, or scenes missing, etc. RHPS has a different opening for example. Are the scripts here the original ones or something?</p><hr><p><b>Cathy Baldwin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie EVER made. I've seen it over 200 times and I can never get tired of it. It's my one and only obsession. If it wasn't absolutely amazing, then how can you explain how it's one of the biggest cult films of all time? It has to be great for so many people to be head over heels in LOVE with it. I have to admit, the first time watching it, it's pretty confusing. Which just makes you want to watch it again because it leaves you wondering "what just happened?". That's because there isn't another movie out there like it, so you weren't expecting to see something so... out there! But after you watch it a couple of times, it's hard not to fall in love with this movie. Funny, sexual, memorable music, and characters that make you wish that you could be a part of their crazy lives. What's not to love? Definitely a ten. Only because it won't let me go higher.</p><hr><p><b>Olivia Oates</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Quite basically, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is my life, and pretty much the best movie to ever be created! I can watch it over and over, and not once will I grow sick of it.</p><hr><p><b>Jenna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Such a brilliant movie. It's got so much character and personality, you can't get ANYTHING like this anymore, totally one of a kind and something I can never get bored of. Seeing all the 10/10 on this page makes me so happy that there are so many others who really appreciate this magnificent movie.</p><hr><p><b>Rene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I can't say enough good about this movie. Best occult movie EVER. Even before Breakfast Club.</p><hr><p><b>Lilith</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely my life, I even wake up to it in the morning. I dance to it with my baby daughter.</p><hr><p><b>Isadore Elizabeth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my all time favorite movie. In school I had to write about my favorite thing and I wrote a 5 page paper on why I LOVE this movie. I'm watching it as I write this.</p><hr><p><b>John "Ratty" Arbuckle</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>How do I feel about the Rocky Horror Picture Show? To quote Columbia: "IT'S OKAY!".</p><hr><p><b>Random chick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I adore this ilm even today it is outrageous, fabulously so however. As a teenager growing up in the middle of no where in Western Ireland transvestites, corsets and suspenders are not common sights, I absolutely adore this film as exlores the boundaries of sex and relationships in an extravagant way. Frank-n-furter is a fabulous character who seems idolised by many he promotes orgies and although the character is quite selfish he is quite amiable. But above all RHPS is a celebration of the old sic-fi films. I love the scene where rocky, Janet, frank, dr. Scott and brad are all gathered in the lab shouting one another's name over and over again with a ridiculously comical effect. The Writer's love of sic-fi is evident in the creation of the 'horror' rocky who has only half a brain s Frank gave him half of his estranged lover Eddie who was played by meatloaf. Also there was that marvellous concept that Frank, magenta and riff raff are aliens from the planet 'transexual' in the galaxy of 'transilvania' is the be all and end all of all plot twists. So overall this is a fabulously weird, wonderful and sexy film! Everyone must watch it! It is loved by all of my family both young and old and if given the chance I would build my wardrobe base on Frank-n-furter's look.</p><hr><p><b>Hatie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am 13 and I saw this movie two weeks ago and ever since then it is all I talk about. I am Absolutely obsessed, I've been wanting to watch it since I was 10 by my mom said I couldn't until I was 13. It is the greatest ever. Me and my friends are all performing it. I am directing and acting. I AM COLUMBIA. She is the best character definitely.</p><hr><p><b>A Regular Frankie Fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The most spectacular, one of a kind movie I've ever seen. There is no other movie like it, and no other movie with a cult following as intimate and personal. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe in, you with find it quite easy to identify with Rocky Horror since the overall message and lesson portrayed in the film is uniform to everyone. You will find it hard to not smile when Frank-N-Furter rips off his cape or dance along to the "Time Warp" (it's just a jump to the left!) The creative flare and genius of this movie is obvious; the characters, the setting, the props, etc. (you wouldn't have people dressing up in full blown Rocky Horror costumes if it was boring, trust me.) If you haven't seen the film or have seen it, but not at the movies, you are still a virgin! If I were you, I would go to the movies (the sooner the better), buy a ticket and have a freaking good time at a midnight showing of RHPS. Remember; don't dream it, be it.</p><hr><p><b>Crazy Greg</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Admittedly, I love TRHPS. I would see it anytime, anywhere that I could. I am even including it in our wedding celebration. It is that big of a part in our lives. Is it the greatest movie of all time? That is subject to opinion. However, just because you love TRHPS does not mean that you have to "grow up" as someone here said. That is the purpose of the movie and the experience. The fact that you can act childish, foolish, exhilarated, jubilant, and crazy once again, well after you have "grown up". I give the movie 9 stars because of its importance in my life. The only reason I don't give it ten, is because I do not think that it is the 'greatest' movie of all time. That honor goes elsewhere. However, again, this is a great movie when combined with the experience that goes with the partici--- (say it!)--- pation.</p><hr><p><b>CAM</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This is the weirdest and worst movie I've ever watched. I had to watch it for a class and I never want to watch it again. I could barely get through it.</p><hr></td>
