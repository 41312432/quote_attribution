    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>bharu</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I like the film lot. Visual effects used in the film are simply amazing and mind blowing. I like cameron very much.</p><hr><p><b>CESAR</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was the winner all around the world. The academy should take that in mind when deliberating on such matters. Movies are realeased all over the world. They should make an internet world survey taking into account the world's opinion.</p><hr><p><b>Khulekani S Zulu</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie so much I just want to read the full script just to see the writers mind.</p><hr><p><b>Serpico</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Come on, this was one horrible script. As impressive as the movie was visually, the script was just awful. Pocohontas meets the Smurfs doesn't even begin to cover it.</p><hr><p><b>LIttleleeroy</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This script is not the same as the movie that I watched on Blu-Ray or at the movies (IMAX and Real3D). The start of this script is completely different. Maybe it's different in USA? I'm in Australia.</p><hr><p><b>Nomvele Ntobela</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow this script is just great, but the first part is unfamiliar-it's not on the dvd, but it's a great script either way. The movie itself, just captures you and you have no choice but to concentrate. Well done James Cameron.</p><hr><p><b>Miribella</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie, but it was also really interesting to see the script. I wish the Norm-Trudy storyline had stayed in, but I also liked a lot of the smaller changes they made for the final product.</p><hr><p><b>Stephanie</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The first part of the script is most definitely different, but very well might have been a cut scene, and they decided not to film it. Just a guess.</p><hr><p><b>victor dickson</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Avatar for me is one of those evidence that proves that the best of creativity will always be found around wall-breakers and box breakers.</p><hr><p><b>jerry</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best of all! Everything is mind blowing the special effects and the colors oh my god I love it cameron is simply the greatest.</p><hr><p><b>somejerk</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was so overrated. It was good because of the visual graphics, but other than that, the movie is just like every other "save the forest" campaign. I get it, don't get me wrong the forest is awesome, but how many times can you do the same song and dance?</p><hr><p><b>Caldlow</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>People, please. All those 8-9-10 star ratings. I can't believe it. I went to the cinema with high expectations, and I have never ever been so disappointed in my life. The script is, let's face it, awfully bad. People explaining each other things like they have never seen each other before, and "unobtanium"? People, "unobtainium"? Where will it end. It's like a kid's cartoon, with crappy names, no storyline, no dialog, no emotion. Why is there such a hype? Why? Please, please tell me. If it's about the SE, I can't believe that. I've seen more films with beautiful special effects.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Overall, I enjoyed this film, but only for its visuals and because of the fact that it is a science fiction story. The script seemed as if it were conceived in a matter of ten minutes- almost seeming like a first draft. Its full of cardboard characters and predictable outcomes, along with dull flat dialog and scenes full of terrible exposition (This is why we're here- unobtanium!?). As I said, the visuals were amazing and its what saves the film, but the script wasn't even nearly on the same level. It certainly had the great potential to be something much better- its just too bad it never got there.</p><hr><p><b>alexa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the BEST movie I've ever seen. It truly was an experience to watch on the Imax. It has a great story and its all around just outstanding. It should have won on the mtv awards it deserved it. I look forward to seeing another one of James Cameron's masterpieces. It really is a must see. So enjoy and god bless.</p><hr><p><b>TomH</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The visuals were great, but the story was a boring rehash of a ton of cliches. Plus it was a heavy-handed environmental message. It's like he just remade "Pocahantas" shot-for-shot. I'm glad this didn't win Best Picture. It didn't deserve it.</p><hr><p><b>King</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>There's actually a lot of scenes missing from the movie. I heard that there were almost 40 minutes of the movie cut because IMAX only allows a movie to be no longer than 2 hrs and 40 minutes or something like that. There should be an extended cut to be released in theaters in August with 10 additional minutes and an extended director's cut release on DVD in November.</p><hr><p><b>Hardik</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw the movie which is one of the best ever I saw in my whole life. That's why I read it to know the creativity sense of James Cameron through words.</p><hr><p><b>Nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw the movie and it is the best movie of all time, in my opinion. LOVED the script, LOVED the visual effects, LOVED the plot.</p><hr><p><b>Awesomegodezz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was just awesome! It captured me and I'm not very emotional when it comes to movies but this one made me want to cry. It reminded me of what we would have had we not decided to go into this industrialized version of earth.</p><hr><p><b>Jean</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I really didn't like the movie at all and I was kind of pissed that everybody thought that the movie was so awesome. Seriously? The animations were pretty darn awesome, some with the 3D, but the story sucked so bad. After 10 minutes movie I knew exactly how it would end. Of course everybody would be all happy and everything would be great. God, what a terrible storyline.</p><hr><p><b>Agaligo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Avatar script is great., feel like I'm on Pandora with Jake and the Na'vi. Thanks James and his team for making another great movie for us.</p><hr><p><b>Rawphull</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Everyone has seen this story before, but it is the best version of this story, and to be fair to Cameron he came up with this before Titanic. He would have done this then, but he decided to invent the technology to make it beautiful first. Good move, because you see this for the visuals (Glowy forest oh my god!) and the plot is good enough to not ruin it.</p><hr><p><b>Randy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A wonderful script and well written. James Cameron is a great visionary and I enjoyed reading this script, although a lot has changed in the final draft since a lot seems to be missing when the movie was made. About 45 minutes of the film was cut but that will all be added back in the Collector's Edition when it comes out on November 2010. Awesome film.</p><hr><p><b>marcus</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Haters going to hate. Seriously, haters, you don't hate the movie, you hate the people that love the movie! It happend with dark night too. Focus that hate correctly. As for the movie, I lovet it, I could feel it, I don't care about CGI, effects, script dialogue, jesus stop watching "movies" and just feel the experience.</p><hr><p><b>Stan I.p</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>People. The movie is not just about storytelling! It's about cinematography as WHOLE, including screenplay, photography and all aspects. Now For those who only want to good story, I suggest you a good BOOK. Because we're talking about MOVIE, not Theater not Book. And to make a good MOVIE, even with very simple storyline you got to be a GENIUS to know how to transmit all the emotions to the audience. This is what is all about: MOVIE.</p><hr><p><b>Bella</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie beacuse the effects and the lighting and the fact thst it's impossible, I'd prefer the movies tha tare impossible tah tcan't come true. I just resently saw Brokeback Mountain and I ahev been crying for 8 days. But I love movies atht are I M P O S S I be L E.</p><hr><p><b>Rakariyan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script itself is based from James Cameron's original script for the movie. It's all included in the Avatar Extended Collector's Edition DVD. Watch it and then you will get the actual beginning of the movie. The movie itself is an absolute beauty about the tale of two worlds combined but set in the future and with a whole improved technology.</p><hr><p><b>Robert H.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie! The visuals are great, the story is good (and underrated), the storytelling is great (and it flowed beautifully), and the script is... acceptable. And the moral messages are great. This movie should have won best picture. I'm upset that it didn't. It deserved it.</p><hr><p><b>Lala</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie and this script was just great. I really hoped Trudy and Norm are really meant for each other. Great and awesome movie.</p><hr><p><b>Dauntless Dragon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I was trying the hardest to understand what Jake said as the lid first closed. I would have never figured it out. BRILLIANT.</p><hr><p><b>Theman</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The reason the script opening is different from the movie opening is that the script opening is used in the collector's extended cut on blu-ray and dvd. Great movie by the way. Loved it enough to watch it twice and by the collector's edition. For my generation, x, it may be the next star wars.</p><hr><p><b>MrWhiteman</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>The script is different from the movie, at least from BluRay version.</p><hr><p><b>Lisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the story, enjoyed watching the movie, and the animation was incredible. Thank you James Cameron for doing this movie.</p><hr></td>
