I'll catch this bird for ya but it ain't going to be easy. Bad fish. It's not like going down to the pond chasing bluegills or tommy cods. This shark. Swallow you whole. Little shaking. Little tenderizing, down you go. Now we gotta do it quick. That will bring back all the tourists and put all your businesses on a paying basis. But it's not going to be pleasant. I value my neck a lot more than three thousand bucks chief. I'll find him for 3 but I'll catch him and kill him for 10. Now you gotta make up your minds. You want to stay alive anti up. Want to play it cheap. Be on welfare the whole winter. I don't want no volunteers I don't want no mates, there's too many captains on this island. Ten thousand dollars for me by myself. For that you get the head. The tail. The whole damn thing. Mr Mayer. Chief. Ladies and gentlemen.</p><hr><p><b>Joe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jaws was ok but come on the could have done the shark and special effects better please. I understand that they had to make the shark a robot because it was like 1975 they couldn't animate it but come on please. But other then that it was a great movie. 10 stars!</p><hr><p><b>Chad</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jaws was and still is the best movie I have ever watched. The camera work and the score are top notch and the chemistry between the actors makes every scene that much more real. As far as the special effects go it looks better than anything I see these days. If you don't like Jaws you're not human! Show me the way to go home!</p><hr><p><b>Mick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>We gonna need a bigger boat?</p><hr><p><b>slacky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is just simply one of my most favourite films of all time along with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and A Nightmare On Elm Street (and Scream!). The three male lead actors are very well cast. Dreyfuss is funny as the oceanic expert, Shaw is great as the grizzled sailor and Scheider is perfectly cast as the policeman. My advice is not to watch the sequels though. They're ok but as they say many sequels of the horror genre suck. Jaws 2 is ok, Jaws 3 is the best sequel which is quite good and funny, Jaws:The Revenge is funny but tacky. FACT:Jaws 4 was actually nominated for worst special effects. This is a definite-must-see for fans of the horror classic genre.</p><hr><p><b>Katie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That's a 20 footer! Twenty Five.</p><hr><p><b>Anthony P.</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>To Joe: Dude, they didn't have special effects like they do now, they couldn't do it any other way, and they better not re-make it. This is a great movie no matter what anyone says. Besides I like the song that theyr'e singing on thhe boat before the shark attacks, great drinking music.</p><hr><p><b>Sid</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw this movie as a kid and I was told I lifted my legs up onto the seat at the movie theater.  I was too scared to keep my legs dangling near the floor!  Jaws is my ultimate movie.  Full of childhood fears and wonderment.  I love the ocean and sharks and at the same time, I have a healthy fear of it all.  Thank you Peter Benchley for a lifelong love affair.  God Bless Roy Schieder.  RIP.</p><hr><p><b>jay sims</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite film since childhood.  Quint will always be my favorite movie character. In my opinion, Shaw is what makes this movie so great. His threatening  presence, dialogue, and look are a sight to behold. The Indianapolis speech is one of the great movie scenes of all time. Last but not least his brutal demise near the film's conclusion. That image of Quint reaching for Brody's hand, and  that look of terror in his eyes will always stay with me.  I can only hope that Spielberg will  come full circle and make Quint's Indianapolis experience a reality on the big screen. Shaw's son, Ian, would be a perfect fit to play Quint as a younger man. RIP-- Robert & Roy From a true fan.</p><hr><p><b>John Boland</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jaws is one of the best that every came out of Hollywood. The trio of Shaw, Schieder, and Dreyfuss would have to be a directors dream. Each man adds their own special flare to the movie and collectively they keep the audience captivated during the second half of the film when the men are on the boat. Jaws was not only a blockbuster at the box office, but it also touched at everyone's deep fear of the unknown in the water. Sharks terrify everyone and Spielberg did and exceptional job of building the suspense and then frightening the living #$%# out of you. Anyway have a shot of apricot brandy and here's to swimming with bowlegged women.</p><hr><p><b>JC</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of few movies that I've seen a hundred times. For some reason this movie never gets old. It's sad in a way. Because I wish that I hadn't seen it yet, because watching it for the first time was the most entertained I've ever been. I wish I could watch it over and over again as if for the first time. Anyway, definitely one of the best movies ever made.</p><hr><p><b>peter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw jaws in 1976 when it came to Sydney. It was rated "R" I snuck in anyway. I love this film, I have seen it 100 times, either on dvd or on cable, I can't resist it. The tension on the screen was matched with tension off screen as well; problems with the shark and personality problems between robert shaw and richard dreyfuss. But for me, the highlight of the film was the narrative from quint about the uss indianapolis. Just fantastic (that was written in part by screenwriter john mullis) so, farewell and a do to you fair spanish ladies, fair well and a do to you ladies of spain; for we've received orders to sail back to boston, and so never more shall we see you again.. great film, great cast, great director. Amen.</p><hr><p><b>peter avery</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I remember seeing this film in Sydney, Australia in 1976. It was, for its time, edge of your seat stuff. I love the film, even now and always watch it on cable. Robert Shaw as Quint is fantastic. Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were others considered for the role of Quint, but can you imagine a better Quint than Shaw? Roy and Richard were very good as well, and it is a pity we have lost both. The film is a classic in its genre and will forever be the film to launch Steven Spielberg into the stratosphere. Truly fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>DJ Mike Bordez</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie so much. Quint is such a great character. It's horrible to see him in such pain at the end, because you're made to really root for his curmudgeonly self. I think it's one of the most visceral deaths ever in a movie though. You're right about the look of terror in his eyes when Brody loses his hand, and it's magnified a thousandfold when the shark clamps down into his midriff and they show the closeup of him screaming, his mouth wider than I can even get mine to go, his squinted eyes on fire with terror and agony. Then that shot of Brody grimacing and the horrid view of Quint in the shark's mouth, his bare belly squirting blood, the teeth puncturing his organs and flesh. Then after he is consumed, you get to see tatters of his dead flesh dangling from the shark's teeth, swinging back and forth, a kind of lardy trophy for the shark to laugh at Brody with!</p><hr><p><b>evan M</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I first didn't want to watch this movie, but once I saw it I was amazed! The special effects, the music, the acting, and the cinematography is great! Jaws is not just a great monster movie. It's a great movie all together.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the greatest movie of our generation. My father (born in 1939) will say Casablanca. Indeed, a good movie. But Jaws was not only a great movie, it affected our culture. In my 40's and I still have that second of fear when hitting the water at the beach. And for me, the most powerful scene in entertainment history. Chief Brody just finishes an adrenaline rush with the kids with the phony fins to a let down of monumental relief. He is then informed, by his wife, that the shark is in the area where HE sent his son to swim-and then has to run to save his son and is basically helpless and at the mercy of chance. Any father would be experiencing panic and fear during that run that may feel like a million years rather than a few seconds.</p><hr><p><b>Aaron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! It is one of Spielberg's best cinematic moments in the history of cinema. I love John Williams' score and I loved reading this script by Peter Benchley. I can't wait for a 3d version of this film.</p><hr><p><b>John Henderson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing! I had the pleasure of meeting Roy Scheider before he passed on. His family are very, very close friends of mine. God bless the Scheider family.</p><hr><p><b>Jeff</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>It's difficult to read reviews that complain about the effects in Jaws. You must judge a movie for what it did when it came out (over thirty years ago!), and the makers of Jaws did amazingly well. The slew of shark movies to come AFTER did have better effects, yet these movies sucked. I've NEVER seen another shark movie worth watching. Jaws is king. It's this script I'm curious about. It feels like a very rough draft. Poorly written, in my opinion. Even if scripts were composed differently back in the 70s, the end products is still weak. The movie succeeded despite the script. After reading this screenplay, "Stillness In The Water," I respect Spielberg's movie even more.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the jaws series but I did not watch the 4th one because I heard it was stupid. In my opinion it was violent along with skinny dipping in the beginning so I don't think it would be appropriate for older kids to see, probably 10 year olds if they can take the violence. I myself had no problem with it and I'm 11, turning 12 soon and I was like 9 or 10 when I got the movie.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Casablanca, Citizen Kane, forget that, this is the greatest movie. Watch the sequels, they're a little bad but still worth the watch. I saw all of the movies when I was 4 and even though now that I'm 13 I still have a love for jaws.</p><hr><p><b>keef</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script isn't accurate. During the scenes preceding the death of Alex Kintner, the Dog Man' with the Black Labrador is calling out the name 'Pipit', not Buster.</p><hr></td>
