A great movie to watch with family and laugh at.</p><hr><p><b>Lisa B</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was the BEST. It's me and my moms fave movie. When I saw it I cried cause I did NOT want to see it, then I cried cause I WANTED to watch it again.</p><hr><p><b>norbert</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I cried like 20000 times. But then again I smiled like a million times. That wicked witch. Ugh where to start. WHAT A BULLY. I wish you could do that with real bullies just pour water over their heads and they would just melt! Now that Dorothy. She's so sillly and she's the epiphany of my former self. She whines, giggles, gets into trouble and seeks to find a place where there isn't any trouble. Wow a place where there isn't any trouble. Aren't we all searching for a place like that deep inside ourselves? The truth is this movie reminds me of my childhood.</p><hr><p><b>nicolas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was a great movie, I like it. It has some scary parts in it, just makes my day. I really start getting into the spirit when she first comes out into the light and it is colder. It is really like the movie. Who DOESN'T like the wizard of of oz? Stupid people that's who.</p><hr><p><b>Shana-Nicole</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the wizard of oz. It is the best movie ever. I love it.</p><hr><p><b>sylvani</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The wizard of Oz is a wonderful story and it inspired a lot of writers to write a new story. Just like Wicked, a great book (and musical) that gives you a bigger picture about the characters & how the wicked witch gets to be wicked.</p><hr><p><b>Madison</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I want Dorothy to tell the bad witch to keep her monkeys out of her castle. I would not tell Dorothy that I want the ruby slippers and I want to tell the bad witch I want the ruby slippers. I would love for Dorothy to come to my house today.</p><hr><p><b>Kaely</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever! My middle school is doing it for out spring musical and I'm Glinda. The only problem is that I'm somewhat bad at high notes.</p><hr><p><b>Danielle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the wizard of oz! The little munchkins are the greatest and I love the characters, I think this should done again. It's awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Mellany</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>You know, after reading Wicked and seeing the play I don't really like the wizard of oz as much. All you people who are saying people who dislike the wizard of oz are idiots, go ahead, call me an idiot, but I feel bad for the wicked witches of the west and east, and I want to hand those slippers over to Elphie and hug her and say It'll be alright. Then again, she's dead. So if I was to hug a melt piled of green goo, I'd do that, but I really don't. I love Glinda in all the movies, but I really love how Maguire gave her a personality, a family, and a story. For those that have read Wicked, I salute you. If you've seen the wizard of oz, go on and read up on wicked. It might change your opinions. It sure did change mine.</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Very cool film, my high school is doing it for the school play this year and I've earned the part of the Wicked Witch. Melting should be fun.</p><hr><p><b>Sydnie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>We did the Wizard of Oz for my school play and I made the part of the Wicked Witch! I just loved painting myself green with A TON of make-up and especially having water dumped on me to my "death"by melting. What's weird is my best friend was Dorothy, but the good thing was that we had fun playing the roles. I still remember all my lines. That's probably because it was last year. And Emily [person playing the Wicked Witch for her High School] - melting is the BEST!</p><hr><p><b>Arjanah</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>My school is doing the wizard of oz for the 2008-2009 school year. I am only 11 and I am in the 6th grade. But I would like to be Dorothy, Scarecrow,or Tin Man, or Wicked Witch of the West. To be Dorothy, I think I would be good at it the thing is I do not really look like her at all, do you think I could still tryout and succeed that part? Any good words of advice before I tryout? Overall the Wizard of Oz is a great play.</p><hr><p><b>Marisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the Wizard of Oz! Toto is very ugly but he is a good dog. RIP Judy Garland (A.K.A Francis Ethel Guam).</p><hr><p><b>joe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The same writer did not write wicked that wrote the wizard of oz, so who's to say that those two stories got together? Sry the wizard of oz is a hit SINGLE. 100 years from now people will still only remember the wizard of oz. Sry I don't believe in a part two unless its officially done by an original writer.</p><hr><p><b>ava Stefanelli</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wizard of oz has become a part of my life since I was a little kid. It's problems everyone has to deal with but no one realizes it. We all feel like we want a heart sometimes and sometimes we feel like we lack courage. So you see maybe were not going to be swept up in a tornado but we all have a little oz inside of us.</p><hr><p><b>lauren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The wizard of oz is the best, I have got all of Dorothy's cool stuff.</p><hr><p><b>Haley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! Tomorrow my drama club is doing the play! I am so excited. I got the part of Dorothy. My best friend got mad at me because she tried out for Dorothy but got the wicked witch. My other friend Auntie Em. My worst enemy was really close to getting the part of Dorothy but she ended up with Glenda. My boyfriend got the scarecrow and that is awesome. Oh and one more thing, those people who don't like the wizard of oz are idiots - well that's really not nice its just their opinions.</p><hr><p><b>Cayleigh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well. To begin, I believe that the Wizard of oz is a particularly excellent film. It is obvious how well planned out the movie was (the people from kansas all being a part of her dream/the three men commenting on courage, heart, and brain back in kansas) Overall, I absolutely love this movie and say that if you havent seen it then your crazy. ITS A CLASSIC! I first saw it when I was two and it's been a personal favorite all throughout my childhood.</p><hr><p><b>Dean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The characters are rich and indelible in movie history. There is a character to which everyone can relate. Why isn't this film rated the best movie of all time? There is no other film ever made which compares, and I've seen over 10,000 movies.</p><hr><p><b>Jordan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really think that the movie is such a great movie and it really inspires young actors or maybe readers a idea of what you could do in your life and I love all the characters in the movie: Dorothy, Toto, scarecrow, lion, and the tin man they're so cute and have their own personality to them.</p><hr><p><b>Lucy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My school are making the wizard of oz drama, and I am playing a role as a MUNCHKIN.</p><hr></td>
