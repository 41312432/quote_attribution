Truly brilliant! A little sickening in some parts, but otherwise, excellent!</p><hr><p><b>laura</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i can't watch movies after i seen this, they're so boring compared to it
CLOCKWORK ORANGE!</p><hr><p><b>Gorka</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film I have ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>Astral Projection</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is just perfection...</p><hr><p><b>chrism</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film would put you on classical music this is one of the best films I have ever seen a truly a masterpiece.</p><hr><p><b>Greyson Futrell</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Stanly Kubrick shows us again his brilliant film style in 1971's Clockwork Orange. Ludwig Van Beethoven, milk drinking and ultraviolence all make up Alex DeLarge's life in a great tale about a psychopath teen who goes to jail and is brainwashed by the government. Alex may not have been subdued very long by the brainwash technique but I was in astonishment of this classic masterpiece.</p><hr><p><b>Robert</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A great film.  The acting is flawless.  The music is perfect for the film.  It explores many deep themes of morality, good and evil.  Brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick.  However, the graphic and explicit sex scenes may be a turnoff to most people. Yet it remains a great piece of cinema.</p><hr><p><b>Alizabeth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was the most brilliantly portrayed novel-to-silverscreen adaption I have EVER seen. I am only 13 and most people my age would find this movie sickening in some way, shallow minded as they are, but I however found it to be the most interesting movie I have ever seen! As far as I'm concerned, this is the greatest movie of all time!</p><hr><p><b>T. R. Hentsch</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film! I first saw it when I was about thirteen and to this day it remains my favourite movie of all time. Stanley Kubrick is an absolute genius and, despite his pasing in 1999, his work is still inspirational. Only he could have made something so graphic look so beautiful. This film is truly something that should never be ignored. </p><hr><p><b>Zed</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Outstanding piece of work, best film (and book) ever made. The very best to this day.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Depth on a level I never thought was possible in a movie.</p><hr><p><b>seth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen many many movies so far. But this one is not only a movie. It's a part of reality. I've watched it many times.</p><hr><p><b>T</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>He's not drinking straight milk you idiot, it's LSD laced Milk, hence the Korova Milkbar name.</p><hr><p><b>Fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film, it's my favorite ever. Kubrick did an amazing job in this one.</p><hr><p><b>Oana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a real MASTERPIECE! Also, Malcolm McDowell is brilliant in the role of Alex DeLarge. I can't believe that he didn't take the Oscar for Best actor, I mean he was amazing! Anyway it's a cult movie. Absolutely INTIMIDATING!</p><hr><p><b>Mitch</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, I cannot get enough of it. The musik is perfect, I find myself govoretting in the language they speak. McDowell is awesome but I don't see why he hasn't been as good in other movies.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh bliss! Bliss and heaven! Oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh. It was like a bird of rarest-spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures!</p><hr><p><b>Rebecca</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Actually, Mitch; Malcolm has done pretty good roles. O Lucky Man counts for one of his best I have to say but this. I can't begin to say how much I "adore" this movie. I'm only 13 and it is probably the best films I've ever seen. You don't actually see movies like this anymore. They don't actually make good movies anymore. Most of the good movies reside in the earlier years. Not now. With the CGI stuff, people overuse their film privileges. Sad sad. It is hard to like this movie because of the sexcapades in it is definitely a turn off to most. It is an acquired taste. You have to know you can possibly handle it and it will come good in the end.</p><hr><p><b>bobby b</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Having heard so many things about this film, I didn't know if I was gonna like it just because it's one of the best or because of my own feelings. Now I've seen the film and it is one of the few films to shock me and I say Kubrick is certainly one of the few that has made masterpieces such as this one.</p><hr><p><b>P.Richardson</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The novel was better and had a more human message. Well acted? Yes. Well directed? Yes. But weak in its struggle to understand itself. Like A.I. it doesn't really know what it's trying to accomplish.</p><hr><p><b>Wangari</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What can I say about this movie, brilliant isn't even a word when you compare it to other movies. Directors should be ashamed of the kind of movies they make nowadays where is Kubrick to make wonderful movies like this for a new generation! Gosh it was destiny for Malcolm Mcdowell and Kubrick to come together and make a movie like this, I guess the reason why Malcolm hasn't performed as brilliantly in other movies would be that those movies did not have the supreme direction of Kubrick. Most actors who have acted in Kubrick movies gave their best performances in those particular movies because of all the meticulous nature of Kubrick.As Kubrick said the only people who he could call genius were Malcolm Mcdowell, James Mason and Peter Sellers and Malcolm of all the three was absolutely superb gosh you get shivers from that eyelash stare and the sound of his voice over is brilliant he did a brilliant narration, a Clockwork Orange is both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p><hr><p><b>Anthony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@Alizabeth I am a little frightened that you were allowed to see this film at thirteen years old. Although I don't think you should wait until you are 21 or anything, I do feel that the level of disturbing things in this film could warp a growing child's mind, and you might not be able to comprehend the film on all of it's levels. I also hope you keep watching films, because although it is an incredible film, I wouldn't say it is the greatest ever made. Try: Citizen Kane (obviously) Vertigo (and many other hitchcock films) The Godfather (1972) La Règle Du Jeu (Renoir) The Seven Samurai (Akira Kurosawa) or Battleship Potemkin (Sergei Eisenstein).</p><hr><p><b>Ingmar Tarkovsky</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Funnier than what I remember it to be. Still potent after all these years but its original flaws are still there. 2001 remains his classic.</p><hr><p><b>Aaron </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If Malcom Mcdowell improvised singing, singing in the rain. How it is written in the screenplay? Did he later type that in the screenplay after he filmed it?</p><hr><p><b>Justin </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>To Aaron: No, Mcdowell didn't improvise it. What happened was that the scene originally didn't have the "Singin' in the Rain" scene, but the cast and Kubrick felt that there was something missing to it. After a few days, Kubrick thought of the idea to include it in the screenplay for Mcdowell to sing it. It was a revision to the orignal.</p><hr></td>
