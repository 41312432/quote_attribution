Maybe even the most perfect script ever</p><hr><p><b>Patroklo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Maybe the best film ever. Awesome dialogs, incredible characters and a very beautiful love story.</p><hr><p><b>lauren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! If you haven't seen it go watch it now!</p><hr><p><b>Proctor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie, only problem is the script is in PDF format.</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Enough of this movie! Get a hold of yourselves, it blew goats. You know you don't like it so why pretend you do?</p><hr><p><b>Ancient Wind</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Stands the test of time, every time! period. In spite of it being a wartime movie, the propaganda still stands because it has universal values. When you go and see movie at 3am in the middle of a Chicago blizzard because the theatre (THE CLARK) changes its billings daily, you must be crazy or really keen on a movie. Put me down as keen, not crazy.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A classic.</p><hr><p><b>Grace</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A real classic! In this movie you'll just find everything that contributes to a great romance. All the following movies just have to find inspiration from Casablanca. Besides the chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart is just unforgettable.</p><hr><p><b>burry</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>It was very boring and old.</p><hr><p><b>daniel frilay</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This was the worst movie I have ever seen, they made me sit there through school and watch it. I seriously almost fell asleep, it was that bad.</p><hr><p><b>sean Reynolds</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this screenplay.</p><hr><p><b>alistair</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Breaks all the rules. Best reluctant hero. Dialogue that is unrivalled. Not everyone's taste but if you take writing seriously there are none better.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There are children here too young to appreciate the beauty and elegance of this film. Jesse is a surprising culprit, purporting as he does to be some sort of film buff. It's beautifully shot and scripted with bags of matinee idol glamour. And for a film that features the most number of memorable lines in cinema history it seems puerile to say it 'blew goats'.</p><hr><p><b>Corey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the most romantic movie ever. It's a classic and certainly not boring. This is my favourite movie of all time and if you knew anything about film, you'd agree with me.</p><hr><p><b>Erik</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It looks like I'm the only guy to give it 10/10. Oh wait, Dan gave it 10. Great movie though. SEE IT NOW!</p><hr><p><b>Josephson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>
 I love this great movie. I could watch it over and over. I cannot believe this site has the whole entire script. I hope I have enough paper around. I would love to have the script. You have a great site going and I would love this site even more if you had Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator script. See you later.</p><hr><p><b>Ann</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is one of the movies I like best.</p><hr><p><b>Will</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If you didn't enjoy this movie then you're either very young or a nazi or possibly both. After the Bible the greatest thing ever written by committee. A complete fluke by all accounts.</p><hr><p><b>alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good movie, what a classic.</p><hr><p><b>Nay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best script EVER!</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Just watched this sublime movie again for about the fifth or sixth time and enjoyed it as much as ever. It's a film I can never get tired of. So many quotable lines and memorable scenes. Anyone who finds it boring must have the attention span of a retarded rodent.</p><hr><p><b>movieman</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie is very bad. People think classics are good because they loved them when they were kids. This is totally lame and I wouldn't dare to sit through it again!</p><hr><p><b>Craig</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever made. This movie uses the supporting cast like no other movie. If even one charactor was missing the whole movie would fall apart. It is a complete movie. Love, death, suspense and doing the right thing are all contain in this classic movie. If you can't see the depth of love and emotion in this movie, you are either too young and immature or you are living without passion in your life.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Re: 'Movieman', pah! What kind of monicker is that for a man who simply appreciates nothing about the great medium of film? People tend to think that classics are good because, well, you said it yourself- they're called classics. And I doubt that very many people here could have first fallen in love with this movie as kids, since it's sixty-five years old! Think first please.
.</p><hr><p><b>filmboy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>People who vote this film low are imbeciles that will never understand good storytelling or characters. This film is timeless, the screenplay is as good as it gets and it shows because it is regarded all around the world as perhaps the greatest picture ever. Sorry naysayers, but you’ve got no taste or sense.</p><hr><p><b>tony</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Some people think that because a movie is black and white and because some snobby film critics say it's good, then it must be good. Those people are wrong. This only goes to show how commercialism can influence the movies people like. Watch this movie if you're having trouble sleeping.</p><hr><p><b>critic</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>It was a milestone achievement of neolithic cinema. But that's still not a saving grace for Casablanca. Worthless to an informed contemporary viewer sans any interest in the history of Hollywood cinema, few if any merits of its own.</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Critic (a joke, surely) dismisses Casablanca as "neolithic cinema". Ouch! Is that like the drive-in movie theatre on The Flintstones? Or does it just mean there weren't any CGI explosions to keep your brain from slipping into hibernation? Meanwhile, Tony makes the devastating observation that the "movie is black and white" (nothing escapes these geniuses) and that a number of "snobby film critics" like it. Obviously there can be few worse fates for a movie than to be appreciated for over six decades by anyone who actually knows something about films. It just invites ignoramuses, operating under the postmodern delusion that their opinion is as valid as anyone elses, to try and show how brave and individual a thinker they are by slagging it off. Well sorry guys, but you couldn't be more wrong.</p><hr><p><b>Galaxy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"we'll always have paris". Nothing more to say.</p><hr><p><b>beans</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I'd love to see such a brilliant script, plot and cast of characters revisited for a contemporary audience. I'd cast Joaquin Phoenix/George Clooney as Rick, Tim Robbins as Laszlo, Renee Zellweger as Ilsa, Sean Penn as Captain Renault, Harrison Ford as Major Strasser, Jeff Rush as Signor Ferrari, Steve Buscemi as Ugarte and as Will Smith as Sam; Clint Eastwood directing. Having said that, why mess with perfection. And, for those that don't yet 'get it'; give yourselves time. If, after maturing, it still eludes you then I pity you.</p><hr><p><b>x</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I'm definitely not a Nazi, and I have to say, I loved the film. For all the wrong reasons. The acting was the worst thing I've seen since... probably Jason Schwartzman in Marie-Antoinette; the script somewhat thin and heavily weighted by the legion of cliches. And the less said about Bergman the better. But it was very, very funny, although my english teacher almost lynched me when I burst out laughing during the "You're only saying that to make me go!" line. Great cinematography and technical work, given the time period, and I have to confess that I loved this film. Just not for the same reason as the rest of you.</p><hr><p><b>Geoff</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Yeah, look how cool and controversial I am. Casablanca sucks! Eat that, bourgeois cultural hegemony!</p><hr><p><b>Sean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>X, The legion of cliches of which you speak are cliche precisely because of Casablanca's impact on our culture. Shakespeare was fresh too at one time. To all 'cool and controversial' enough to rate Casablanca a one- go make a better film. Come back in six decades. If anyone is still raving about yours, you get to sit at the big table. This film a classic for good reason. It is close to perfection. The script is clear, concise, centered on the problems of three little people yet telling a larger story. I doubt any adult could fail to be moved when two lovers sacrifice their only chance at happiness for the greater good. Blaine is a man who is no stranger to good causes but due to a broken heart has become the jaded drunkard who does not stick his neck out. In the course of the movie he does just that- for the woman who broke his heart and her leader of the-resistance husband. Blaine does what is right, not what is easy. In the end all the characters still alive are redeemed by his action, even the corrupt yet thoroughly well-liked chief of police, Renault. This is a story about growing up, taking responsibility for yourself and others, and giving without getting anything in return. I'm not surprised that kids don't understand. All their parents do though.</p><hr><p><b>Andy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw this as a kid, and didn't really understand it. When I saw it later again in my late 20s, I loved it. I think if you don't have the necessary life experience, it's hard to appreciate it. Kids should stick to movies about magic, dragons, and spaceships, until they're mature enough to enjoy movies like this.</p><hr><p><b>Richa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hailing from a small town in India where English is a distant third language, forget English movies- I saw this movie a week ago, having never seen or heard anything about it earlier and what can I say-Its an Unparalleled Classic! Romance, War, Drama, Relations, Comedy, Beauty, Cynicism-I would not have dared to dream such a masterpiece even exists if I had not seen it myself! I am still on the path to discovering classic movies and I am sure when I see "Gone With the Wind", 'Wizard of Oz" and many others in coming days, I will appreciate many other classics also. But Casablanca will always remain special to everyone who has a fully functional heart and brain!</p><hr><p><b>Gabz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>An absolute classic. Casablanca is a depiction of the trials of the War and the themes are timeless. Subtle nuances, political implications and lessons in self-sacrificing for the 'Greater Good' are appreciated and lacking in modern films. Beautifully done.</p><hr><p><b>joker</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>We all have our own tastes.  This one wasn't mine.  I have to say after all the hype I was disappointed.  Even when overlooking the dated direction, stiff acting and one liners, I really didn't see much dimension in the characters or the story.  Normally this is made up for by tension in the plot or a series of sub plots.  Again I found this wanting.   It was more like pantomime than a slick 40’s thriller.  The only character I really liked was Renault and his cocky one liners.

Most of all though, for me, I think movie failed because I really couldn’t appreciate the love story and feel for the characters. I have to say I have seen/read more poignant love stories where someone has sacrificed his love or life for the greater good.  This isn’t a bad movie – it’s got its moments, just not enough for me.  It certainly wouldn’t be in my top 10 of all time.
</p><hr><p><b>joshua</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think a lot of Casablanca's detractors respond so fiercely because so many people say it's such a classic and the best film ever. There are a number of better films out there now, but that should not detract from the fact that this film, in the context of its time, was extremely good. Some of the script has become cliche because so many people have repeated it, but overall the plot and the script are still beautiful even today. The acting and direction are simply products of their time, unspectacular by today's standards, but still remarkable in their ability to interest audiences even fifty years later. Best film ever? No way, but nonetheless an excellent story.</p><hr><p><b>Simon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The music is awesome. And although the lines are cheesy, I doubt anyone else can pull them off as well as Bergman and Bogart.</p><hr><p><b>MrMojoRisin</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>One of the most over hyped movies I have ever seen. The acting was average at best, the plot boring as hell and dialogue old and outdated, I’m a big movie fan but I have to say this movie has been built up by people entertained by cheesy on-liners to be one of the "best movies of all time" in my opinion it shouldn't even be mentioned in the top 100.</p><hr><p><b>Michael</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Casablanca has been my favorite film since I was 15 years old. It's a study in character (in both the literary sense and the virtuous sense) sense of place (who wouldn't want to spend an evening at Rick's?) and story. They don't make them like this anymore. I don't know if it's the Best Film Ever, because choosing the Best Film Ever would be heavily subjective, but it's on the top of my list.</p><hr><p><b>Juls Leonard</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wait. How do you even get the script if I may ask.?</p><hr><p><b>DEJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>When you read the comments on the low ratings you have to ask, do these people know the difference btween a script and a movie?</p><hr><p><b>Clarke</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great film, it transcends age and time. I'm 21 it doesn't take age to appreciate a film like this. Anyone who's ever loved can respect the choices made by these timely characters.</p><hr><p><b>Jeanrick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A very timeless and the most effective script ever. Superb! The choice of words, the pacing EVERYTHING! The best script ever made.</p><hr><p><b>Reviewer</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>It pains me as a film lover and critic that Casablanca has been given so much undeserving credit and praise. People are somehow won over by the "period-piece" aspect of it. Had this movie been made now, its weak plot, slow pacing, unrelatable characters and hyped-up one-liners would be ground to the ground by a well informed public. It is not the worst movie ever but the lack of action, story and creative achievement does not fool me into accepting this as a great.</p><hr><p><b>Harvey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>To that guy called Tony, who says it's in black and white, that's because it was made before colour film was invented. All the other people who say it's boring, go back to your CGI explosions and people shooting each other.</p><hr><p><b>Arsene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>To Harvey, there were color movies made some time before this one.</p><hr><p><b>Sam Spade</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow it amazes me how many people don't get great cinema. I see a lot of comments about how cheesy this film is and I'm guessing these are from people who like movies like the grudge and blair witch ha you people are a joke, nobody can touch Bogart. NOBODY and for the record you also need to realise that when this film was made talkies were still relatively new so the actors were still used to acting with boisterous campy dramatics, it's just how it was.</p><hr><p><b>movie maker</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was fantastic. I'm more of a horror and action films fan but Humphrey Bogart was amazing.</p><hr><p><b>don</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The first time I watched this film, the first 45 five minutes bored me rigid, then Bergman walks in+ from here on in it's magic. Must have watched this movie at least 200 times, the scene when rick walks into the bar+ sees isla gets me every time. Ok so I should get out more. Please don't try to live your life by movies, they aren't real. I know+ got the scars to prove it. Ok the films totally unbelievable, but this film has some unique charm that somehow grips you in a way no film can. A great cast. Any 1 who's ever loved will get this film. Favourite line. "you used to be a much better liar."</p><hr><p><b>Leila</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Obviously heard of this movie for such a long time, but never got the chance to watch it. Tonight, this error has been corrected. This is a masterpiece. And done in 1942. Obviously a fantastic success, I can only be thankful for Robert McKee to be spending a full day of discussing the script in his class, which has made me watch it in preparation. I should have watched this movie before, but I will be watching it again. I'm not surprised Ingrid has received so many oscar's in her career, she is simply astonishing. And I have to say the moment when they all stand up at Rick's to sing La Marseillaise brought tears to my eyes (yes being french explains it all). I recommend it massively.</p><hr><p><b>Kyle</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>To that guy called Harvey who said "To that guy called Tony, who says it's in black and white, that's because it was made before colour film was invented." That's not right. It came out in 1942. Color film had long existed before that. See The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, both from 1939. Plus many others before that. I'm sorry, but I had to correct you on that.</p><hr><p><b>Zach</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A paragraph of words cannot express or explain why this is THE greatest film ever made. The masterful use of dialogue as both witty banter and characterization by Julius and Phillip Epstein as well as the contributions by Howard Koch (Who was later blacklisted during the Red Scare) make the first reason for this rating. Second, the acting by everyone from Bogart and Bergman down to Yvonne, Captain Galilee, and all the other memorable side-characters that make the setting come alive and keeps the audience's attention the whole way through. The use of many Actors who fled Nazi Occupied Europe to play refugees and the raw emotions that come to the forefront during the La Marseillaise still brings out the reality present at the time the film was released straight to the viewer even today. Lastly, the musical score and the use of relatively minor hit songs such as "It Had To Be You", "Shine", "Perfidia", and "As Time Goes By", work to make emotions run high and utilize the talent of 1920's Bandleader, Dooley Wilson, as Sam, ultimately making the acting more heartfelt and the story more like a romantic ballad. This is why Casablanca can fit into so many great genres from Romance, Musical, and Comedy, to Drama, War, and Film Noir.</p><hr><p><b>senay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I still can't get enough of this movie, and I am a man who doesn't get impressed that easily, vut this movie has one of the greatest scripts I have ever read and I understand people have other views about this movie, I myself have a very different view of Citizen Kane, but fir me Casablanca is lightyears ahead of any movie ever produced, maybe Schindlers list might get a bit close but.</p><hr><p><b>Graham</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>How can the script have an average viewers rating of 8. 56 when every review I see is 10/10? This is the greatest film ever made and I can honestly say it is the only one where I know all the dialogue. The greatest scene in my mind is when the Germans have taken over the piano and are singing German nationalistic songs and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) marches up to the band and says "Play 'La Marseillaise'" Rick nods OK and the band strikes up. The crown goes wild.</p><hr><p><b>Scooby5</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Proof that this is an average movie at best: Change out the stars with other actors and what do you have? Sure, Bergman and Bogart were great, as were other fine actors in the cast. But the script is weak as water and the sets look cheap--like something in a high-school production. I think people who love this overrated movie have seen it so many times that they have lost their objectivity and can't see it for what it is.</p><hr><p><b>DENNIS MHLANGA</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I'd love to see such a brilliant script, plot and cast of characters revisited for a contemporary audience.</p><hr></td>
