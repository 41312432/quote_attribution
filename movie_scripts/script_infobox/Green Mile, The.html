It makes me sad to see the miracle worker have to die in the electric chair. I would rate this movie a 15 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>Jen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie ever. I love watching just because I think it has great actors. Plus, you can't go wrong with Stephen King!</p><hr><p><b>jennie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie, I absolutely love it. I think I know all the words off by heart I have watched it that many times.</p><hr><p><b>Silja</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A perfect script. Absolutely one of the best movies ever made. And of Stephen King adaptations I have to say this is number one.</p><hr><p><b>Jade Cuthbert</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A magnificent script and an outstanding film. This has to be one of my favourite movies of all time, it has some wonderful actors, they all make a good on screen presence and all work and look great together. The author of The Green Mile, Stephen King, has some imagination, that guy is good. I love acting and I am currently looking for work. The one thing I'd love to do is star in a movie that was based on a Stephen King book. This movie was made over 5 years ago and it is still one of the top movies of all time. Well done to all the members of cast and crew, keep up all the good work.</p><hr><p><b>Marsh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Green Mile is superb, I recently watched and studied the film in class for an english assessment. Every scene captured me and made me long to see the next bit that was coming up. This film plays with your emotions making you laugh, worry and keep you on the edge of your seat. Stephen King is just a pro, as well as Frank Darabont. This movie rocks, 10 outta 10. Tom hanks, Micheal Clarke Duncan and all the other actors play their characters exactly the way they shuld be. Excellent work team.</p><hr><p><b>nilesh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Unforgettable rich dialogs, this movie is great.</p><hr><p><b>henry</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This movie is bad. I dunno what the hell you people like about it. I was bored to tears.</p><hr><p><b>collins</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Green Mile is one of the best movies ever made. Every actor played their roles to perfection. The casting director should get an academy award. Who else could have played Percy Whetmore or Wild Bill? Perfect all the way around.</p><hr><p><b>lydia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Green Mile is the best movie I have ever seen. The cast is awesome, everything about the movie is awesome. It's an unforgettable movie.</p><hr><p><b>Becka</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Movie made me cry buckets. Love love love it.</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies King has ever written! And I must add, the best selection of actors possible for each role as well. The plot, character development, acting, everything worked so well in it. Hasn't been a movie this good since Shawshank (another King movie).</p><hr><p><b>Bill</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite movie of all. It's deep and thought provoking. If it doesn't touch you, you've got no soul.</p><hr><p><b>masih</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good. I love watching because of Tom Hanks. Story was good.</p><hr><p><b>Prashanth</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I liked the movie a lot. It's because of the narration being so good that the movie has come out so fine. I haven't read Stephen King's book but after watching the movie, I am thinking of buying the book. Performance by the entire cast is simply superb and the movie is worth a watch.</p><hr><p><b>Dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"He killed 'im with they love. They love for each other. That's how it is ever' day. That's how it is all over the worl'". Best quote ever.</p><hr><p><b>pat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of the best.</p><hr><p><b>M</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best story King has written. Absolute legend of a film.</p><hr><p><b>Jade Cuthbert</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I recently posted a comment but just have to add to it. I just watched the movie again, I have seen it now so many times I know all the words by heart, I speak them when the characters speak them. I recently read the book for an English essay, which I then have to write in my exam in May 2007, this is one fab movie. Love everything about it, lots of great acting. And the character development is outstanding, there is not one character in this movie you can forget. Love it!</p><hr><p><b>Brenda Sears</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It goes without saying the cast is absolutely perfect for the characters, especially John Coffey and Paul Edgecomb. You could almost feel the bond between the two, that's what I liked so much and it really touched me. For those who like blood and monsters it's not a typical Stephen King story but it's definitely worth watching.</p><hr><p><b>Mr. Green</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Henry and his two star rating must have inhaled a few butterflies with that two star rating. From the heart. King's top 3 books and best movie on the silver screen! A must for anyone that loves a "Heroes Ending".</p><hr><p><b>ann</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie is one of the greatest. I just love it.</p><hr><p><b>Marwa</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I've watched The Green Mile twice, and read the script in here. I don't see them matching. There are lines and descriptions in the script that are not anywhere in the movie. Most of the script is written well though. But I was just wondering why the script does not match the movie. Is it supposed to be like that. Some kind of mockery or something?</p><hr><p><b>chad taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie so much. It reminds me of my grandfather because he had to flip the switch for the people in the electric chair. John coffey was so sad in the movie. I felt bad for paul having to watch that. Just like my grandfather. He had to do both. He electrocuted 15 people and just like the movie, he made a friend with one of them, his name was brett lunsford. I have seen the movie four times. It is the best movie with the best actors. I would rate it 30 out of ten.</p><hr><p><b>dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Henry dose not know what he is talking about - 2 stars out of ten, are you nuts? This is one of the best movies of all time. The scene where they're executing Coffey and he tells Paul not to put the bag over his head because he's afraid of the dark moved me to tears.</p><hr><p><b>LFTL</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anyone who rates this below a nine needs to get their head checked, or lacks compassion to an extreme extent! It's an amazing movie with an amazing script, and a great cast. I've also read the book and I have to say, though the book went into quite a bit more detail in terms of Mr. Jingles and the like, I like the book and the film equally. Heartbreaking. My mother was staring at me all through Del's execution wondering why the heck I was bawling so hard. Also at the end, man, I was a wreck. But hey, if you ever need to wash your makeup off quickly, watching this movie is the way'da do it.</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have just this second finished watching this movie, and out of all of it, there is nothing that is more emotional, than John's execution. I have never cried so hard at any movie then i do at this one and to send so many emotions coursing in that period of time, is pure mastery.

Truely one of THE greatest movies made by far!</p><hr><p><b>Jay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i just watched it about half an hour ago and i can say that this is the greatest movie in the whole wide world for me.So many feelings had rushed through in that three hours.And i wish that i could be in that feelings for the rest of my entire life.            god bless Stephen King and also frank darabont for their creation and work                                                </p><hr><p><b>Karl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie has become one of my favorite movies, ever since the first time that I saw it. It is truly a feel good movie. The characters with two exceptions are likable. The performances by all however, are superb. This also one of the few prison movies that is a favorite of mine. The other Movies are: "Brubaker","The Shawshank Redemption" and "Life". They being my favorite prison movies is because in each the characters try to make life within the prisons easy and bearable. The Green Mile being no exception, goes about not just making life bearable but the protagonist even solves their problems.</p><hr><p><b>Romaric</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tonight was my first time watching at this movie, I enjoyed it, I couldn't hold my tears, it made feeling so alive and taught me to not judge people by their appearance or their physic. It shows me how everyone is particular, having or not a noticeable power The way someone rates that movie reveal how deep is humanity is buried in its heart, so that we may need to dig and let humanity come out.</p><hr><p><b>Lisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is such a great movie, for you henry since you were bored, you just didn't get it, the actors did their best and put us right in the midst of the time. This has got to be Stephen King's greatest movie ever, and the story. Real or imagined, makes it the best in my book.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron Dufrain</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Everyone here who has given it a good rating has excellent taste in film. I own the two- disc DVD, the screenplay, the poster, pretty much all of the memorabilia out there for this movie (the very same goes for Shawshank, another King/Darabont story). I can never get enough of it. It's a movie that has soul and deals with the struggles of the human heart when placed in a life or death situation. Great acting, great directing, great writing, and I love the music score for it by my favorite musician Thomas Newman. Kudos to Frank Darabont, Stephen King, Tom Hanks, and everyone who was associated with the making of this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Dave</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I've seen a LOT of 10 out of 10 votes for this movie, which I have to disagree with. Don't get me wrong. I LOVED this movie, but "perfect" it was not-- and I'll tell you why. Like most people, I don't exactly read a book, then go see the movie and critique the adaptation of the script. I base my judgement on a movie-goer's viewpoint (we are, after all, talking about a MOVIE here-- not the book). And, frankly, this movie (while inarguably good) was NOT perfect. In fact, there are TWO major flaws with this movie. The first flaw was casting Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb while usign TALENTED actors in barely-supportive roles (like Gary Sinise as Attorney Hammersmith-- and I'll bet you didn't even KNOW that character's name.) The second flaw-- and the MOST DISTRACTING one for me-- is the concept that once John Coffey absorbs the "negativity" of a situation, he vomits these hoards of flies which spew from his mouth and eventually dissolve into thin air. Ffrankly, that's the point where Stephen King "jumps the shark" with this story. Had he just made John Coffey sick and cough up or vomit the "negativity" as a "normal" substance, I would give this movie another star. But throwing up "flies" that dissolve is just a little too weird-- even for Stephen King. Don't get me wrong-- I am a Stephen King fan through and through. The first book I ever read cover-to-cover was "Thinnner" (don't get me started on THAT crappy movie.) and I have read many of his other works which have been made into film ("Trucks" a. Ok. A. "Maximum Overdrive", "The Body" a. Ok. A. "Stand By Me", "Misery" and "Dolores Claiborne"). But "the Green Mile", frankly, was ruined by that single, stupid concept of vomitting "dissolving flies". John Coffey should have thrown up something physically disgusting like the rest of us to purge himself of the "badness", and the movie would have been nearly perfect (expect for casting Tom Hanks).</p><hr><p><b>Yosef Voycheck</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie is an all time classic that strikes the heart of many people. A book written by Stephen King, transferred to a movie which is a lot like the book with excellence and expert precision. A movie revealing evils in the world, seen from John's eyes who knows pain and hurt. Tom Hanks is a perfect actor for Paul's character. Unlike Dave's comment which is an opinion, not a fact, and for someone who gave it 8 stars and then beats in the actor and one part that he THINKS is messed up. Let me point out, the "flies" represent the disgusting and swiftness of the hurt in the world today. No one wants to see him vomit everywhere, then more people will be revolted, but the dissolving "flies" add mystery to the movie that you make up yourself. Dave's comment is an opinion. I speak the truth, for I often ask Americans, what they like and notice on the movie. Many women have even teared up just by mentioning it, showing strong emotions to a magnificent movie. Even my comrades in Bosnia love this movie, and they never been to America. So Stephen King, Frank Darabont, and Thomas Newman (music) - superb job. Especially Thomas Newman, for the music. I often listen to the score when I'm at my theatre directing or blocking. Matter of fact, I will be directing The Green Mile in a stage production version next year at this theatre. Grand movie. What I say is fact, and not opinion. Although, there is never an absolute truth.</p><hr><p><b>JaneDoe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have watched it so many times I can quote whole scenes. Anyone who didn't cry at the end or was "Bored to tears" obviously didn't even bother to try and watch the movie. As lots of others said, the cast was great and this is one of the best movies of all time.</p><hr><p><b>joe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What is the prison work song.
