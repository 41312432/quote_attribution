Lloyd was day dreaming and he rips out the chef's heart!

</p><hr><p><b>mahdi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>your website is great i just wish you have put the latest movie scripts in your website too like the movie be cool or madagascar</p><hr><p><b>Tommy Taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was awesome!! I watched it like a boggillian times and i can't ever stop watching that movie!





</p><hr><p><b>Timmay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this moovee is stoopid and dum. i hatd how retadrd theY wir in this. know 1 ken bee this dum in reel liffe.

Truly a work of art in stupid comedy, which is my favorite kind of humor. I love to laugh at movies like this and Old School and Wedding Crashers. Just truly amazing films that'll last until we're all so old, computers will be like atari's. Jim Carry obviously steals the show, but would not have gone far without Jeff Daniels acting as a counter weight to balance this act out. Daniels brought stupid to an even more realistic level with the character of Harry, a character we can all empathize in, as he's probably much like some one you know, and Lloyd being an over the top idiot whom may be less realistic, but none the less hilarious. 

This will always be the Farrelly brothers' best work. Dumb and Dumberer was alright, I got some laughs out of it, for sure, but... not like I did Dumb and Dumber. This film just captures the idiocy of people that are probably out there somewhere. 

And hey... you're it.</p><hr><p><b>Bobby St. Pierre</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie was awful.  Everyone is now dumber for having seen it.</p><hr><p><b>AntiTard</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Amen Bobby St. Pierre, STUPID movie! What was the point?</p><hr><p><b>shawn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watched D&D for the first time in a theater full of teenagers. I spit up my soda and laughed so hard my cheeks hurt by the end. I went back again to see if it was just the teenage energy wave that hit me. It wasn't -- just flat out funny.

When I finally got around to reading the script, I found myself laughing out loud. I never do that with scripts. Just the bare bone silliness of it all.

The best part in the movie, though, wasn't in the script I read -- no time to stop the bike for a pee break. Then they arrive stuck together. Kills me.</p><hr><p><b>Aj</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Beautiful.</p><hr><p><b>venus</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is by far one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I have seen it a million times and it still cracks me up haha. It's great and Jim Carey is awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Lloyd&Harry</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The rating given is for the script, not for the movie.  The movie is great.  There are some parts of the movie missing in this version of the script.  For instance, when Lloyd leaves the bar after being "stood up", he notices a newspaper article on the wall about the lunar landing in the 60's, and comments to all the other patrons about how exciting the news is.  Also, the scene at the gas station where Lloyd mentions "hey, big gulps, huh, guys?..." is also missing.  </p><hr><p><b>Dave</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's not that these scripts are transcripts of the movie, they are the real deal first versions that the writers had in mind. It's not that they left stuff out of the script, we are just getting a good look at how Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels ad-libbed some of the funniest parts of the movie, and how the directors changed plotlines (hearse instead of a scooter, Mary's Husband Bobby instead of Mel Gibson). This makes me truly appreciate Jim Carrey for his brilliance to make this movie hilarious, because honestly, this script isn't all that funny. It has funny parts sure, but the actual movie is 2 hours of non-stop laughing.</p><hr><p><b>Tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Overall okay movie. I thought it was pretty funny at times, but others didn't make a lot of sense. Definitely not the funniest but still good.</p><hr><p><b>Farhad Vafajoo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A movie that you can watch for more than a  hundred times and still find something funny you didn't notice before!</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This was a really good movie. Lloyd was really funny!</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the funniest movies ever made. There's no need for debate.</p><hr><p><b>H</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm sick of people bitching about how bad this movie was. I loved it. I watched it when I was 6 and till this day it still makes me laugh like a psycho and if you have a problem then don't watch comedy, because this movie is comedy! And I have never seen Jim Carrey suck and blow. He makes me laugh and laughing is a good thing!</p><hr><p><b>poop man magoo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I pooped my pants it was so funny.</p><hr><p><b>steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This CANNOT even be considered a movie. It is a film. Best one in the history of mankind.</p><hr><p><b>Solon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>C'mon folks. This is a great film, I can´t believe someone rated it awful. What can be so bad about a comedy film with Jim Carrey?</p><hr><p><b>colie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>By far my favorite movie ever. Screw all the people that said it sucked! This was a masterpiece, great job.</p><hr><p><b>Captain Jesus</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hooray for this magical and enchanting film. I loved it.</p><hr><p><b>NEWBOLD</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, I know like every bloody line and watch it regularly. Jim Carrey is literally my biggest hero. Seriously, watch it!</p><hr><p><b>ALPINEMAN</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No matter your age, if you like to be humored, this film will do it to it. I've been a fan of Carrey since " In Living Color." I thought "Ace Ventura-Pet Detective" was corny, but " Dumb & Dumber" and " The Cable Guy" are Jim's best comedy work in film. Give credit to the Farrelly Bro's also, I like their work, continous funny scene after scene. I love it when C-Bass opens the bathroom stall door, Harry comes in to put the fire out on his pants leg and knocks out C-bass and Lloyd is on the floor sucking his thumb, making that stupid whiny noise.</p><hr><p><b>Gas Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Of course there are things in the movie that are not in the script! That's part of improv. Read any Jim Carey script and let me know which one is exactly as it is written. The script is laugh out loud funny, even though it's not the final cut. Just because the script doesn't have all the subtle changes and add-ons of the film doesn't take anything away from it. It is still a great script.</p><hr><p><b>chickmagnet</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Phenomenal piece of work. You have not truly lived until you have enjoyed the pure, unbridled stupidity of it all. Classic comedy, totally hilarious. Jeff Daniels is great.</p><hr><p><b>shane</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>All critics are no eligible. This movie is great and Jim Carrey makes any movie look genius! Besides, what is there to laugh at that's not stupid? The movie has lots of sense! You just have to have a good sense of humor to understand it.</p><hr><p><b>Kyle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey Timmay the next time you give a movie review, learn how to spell first, you call everyone else stupid but you can't spell simple words. This movie was a comedy, it was suppose to be stupid that was the point, hence the title. Anyone who thinks this movie is no good has no sense of humor.</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is classic. I've watched this movie since I was a little kid probably upwards of 50 times and it never gets old. My bro and I quote this movie all the time. Jim Carrey makes any movie hilarious. His facial expressions are a huge factor in his comedic value. Jeff Daniels was also stellar. They couldn't have casted a better "dumb-ass in crime". To the critics that rated this movie awful with comments and call it "unrealistic", what movie is? That is the whole point. Like the title implies, the movie portrays an impossible level of idiocy regarding social, mental and even physical skills. If you didn't enjoy this movie, you have got to have the worst sense of humor on the face of the planet. Laugh a little. Maybe some of the jokes went right over your head. For example, did you know that the normal work week is 40 hours? There is Dumb, Dumber, and don't forget the Dumbest.</p><hr><p><b>warrentheape</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie has to be brilliant because I love it and I generally hate broad comedies. Dumb and Dumber is about as broad as it gets with comedies, totally unrealistic in every way, but it's freaking perfect. The entire movie has only three serious lines, "I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody. But most of all, I'm sick and tired of having nobody." This creates all the sympathy necessary for Jim Carrey's character and really launches the rest of the film. How the scene was directed is pure genius.</p><hr><p><b>Ihsan</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I consider myself a Dumb & Dumber aficionado (in university I was actually able to recite the entire movie from memory when I was with two friends) and if you think the original is funny you have to find the extended version. There are deleted scenes which are just as classic as everything that made the movie.</p><hr><p><b>There are things missing</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There are items missing here such as  - loosely quoted
"no way that's great, we landed on the moon"
"you know , girls" (scene were Loyd waits for his faked date at the hotel bar)</p><hr></td>
