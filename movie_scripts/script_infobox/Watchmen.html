    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>jdkarlowich</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed the film, as I did the graphic novel. I thought that Zack Snyder and his cast and crew were able to bring a faithful adaptation of Alan Moore's well loved graphic novel. The film is graphic, while also bringing a new look to the superhero film genre. The film may be slow for most film goers, but the 162 minutes zooms by with awesome cinematography, acting and Snyder's great direction. While this film is not along the same level as The Dark Knight, it is still good and 2009's own hit comic book film.</p><hr><p><b>ralph</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed the movie and like Rorschach's character a lot. I hope there can be a part 2.</p><hr><p><b>Aaron</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Sorry Ralph, but there can be no part 2, the film was based off a graphic novel that was only 1, and the film left off where the graphic novel ends. But I loved the film and script a lot, Zack Snyder did a great job. It's a shame people fail to see the depth and genius of Watchmen but it it certainly amazing, great visuals, character development, never a dull moment.</p><hr><p><b>crater</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I was extremely disappointed with Snyder's interpretation of the book and especially his portrayal of the characters Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias. I felt Dr. Manhattan's persona was still too human when compared with the novel. Namely, his voice needed to be deeper, which would have, in addition to creating a more imposing and godly effect, served to sort of balance his voice to make it less expressive, as I viewed Dr. Manhattan in the GN.
Ozymandias in the movie was a little sneering bastard, and even though he acted like he knew everything the aura his actor gave off just made me want to break the screen. I got the impression that Adrian was really a sort of worn out individual who felt alienated from the rest of the world due to his higher intellect. In the book, I almost felt convinced that what he did was right. Almost. I think one of his main traits that they completely overlooked in the movie was his square-ish jaw, which I thought really helped determine his overall character.
The way Rorschach was portrayed was all in all pretty well done, but I think they made him a little jumpy. Sort of. The other characters were very fine, like the Comedian, Nite Owl II, and Laurel, though I don't think they spent enough time at all developing the more minor characters, such as the psychiatrist and the common people. I understand that this may be a result of having to cut back majorly due to time restraints, but still...
One of the things that pissed me off the most was his graphic depiction of the sex between Laurel and Daniel. That was just unnecessary, man.
The soundtrack also put me off. That was just a weird soundtrack.</p><hr><p><b>Annie</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This is honestly one of the most boring movies I've seen. It was too confusing, and nothing interesting or exciting ever happened. There weren't even any cool action scenes to back that up. Even Transformers was better, and that's REALLY saying something. I couldn't even finish the movie, and it was unnecessarily violent. I did have good visuals though, and the only thing worth watching it for is seeing Dr. Manhattan's hot bod.</p><hr><p><b>Will</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies ever, excellent plot, but seems like only people above 125 IQ loved it 'cause lots of people didn't understand the deep drama.</p><hr><p><b>Question</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>@Annie: The reason the movie seemed confusing is that the plot and characters, especially Rorschach was speaking in a very philosophical manner. Transformers is a kind of movie with a somehow shallow plot and a predictable ending (no offense). In Watchmen, if you listen closely to what most of the characters had to say, you will be able to see that they were depicting how "determinism" and "randomness" works.</p><hr><p><b>Oscar Valcarcel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can someone tell me Rorschach's joke, about the opera singer.</p><hr><p><b>Choz'n Penn</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>That chick said it was [unnecessarily violent] and [lacked action]. O_o Film was excellent- not so sure it's a film for those who do NOT appreciate a cynic's humor. The intellect thing might be too insulting for me to say- so YES transformers was shiny with cheap breasts bouncing up and left and a [hollywood] [canned] love story. [ OF COURSE you LOVED IT]. Me? I'll stick with watchmen.</p><hr><p><b>Lilly</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Of course it's not a transformers movie Annie, it's not "just another blockbuster movie" meant for overexcited teenagers with no action in their lives, this is watchmen, an exquisite film about human nature among other rich themes, nevertheless I salute your bravery for standing up (and even coming up with arguments) for such a childish, brainwashed and overall stupid comment.</p><hr><p><b>Someone Something</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I'm a fan of the book and thought the movie was okay, but the pacing was horrible. This script has some more forshadowing, which I like, but some of the changes made to the finished film improved it. I only watched the theatrical cut, so I'm probably going to see the director's.</p><hr><p><b>Peter</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Before Watching the Watchmen I had no idea who they were or anything about the graphic novel, I really thought Nite Owl II was Batman (he sure looks like him). I watched this of all days on late Xmas day 2011, this has to be the most violent superhero flick I ever seen and I like a good dose of violence. Also one of the longest hero flicks I ever seen, anyway Rorschach easily is the best character and the plot was interesting, his investigating made it feel more like a crime story than a typical superhero film. The weakest part of the film is the rather cosy ending it has between Nite Owl and Silk Specter, after everything that happened they just became sellouts to Veidt's utopia, poor Rorschach. Ozymandias, people have mixed views on him, it seems most men hated him in this and most women adored him. I am glad he didn't look like the statue looking man he is in the graphic novel, he looked stupid. I thought Matthew Goode looked like a slick character that can be both intelligent and athletic, which is true to Ozymandias. I hated his plan, disagree with it fully but still respect the character and I did enjoy watching him school the other Watchmen. Overall from the research into the original that I've done since watching this the film sounds like it was a very faithful translation of the source material, I think the film was better in the direction it took near the end. Rorschach's last scene was tragic, a very powerful scene. Definitely worth seeing though because of its length and lack of action considering its length (to stay true to the source material) not a film to watch too often, its story is worthy of debates I must say. Was Ozymandias right in what he did? Can the human race survive?</p><hr><p><b>cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I hated the graphic novel so there's a good chance I'm going to hate this movie, the watchmen are not real heroes, they're just metaphors for heroes, they're posers for crying out loud, and they're straight up losers as well.</p><hr><p><b>sashi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No words can epitomize the brilliance of this movie. Seen it maybe 10 times and each time I love it more. Brilliant metaphor to our hopes and aspirations and how life finally turns out opposed to what we want it to turn out. See it 5 times to see the themes Synder plays with. As Roger Ebert says it deserves repeat viewings. Detractors- take a hike! Surely one of the all time great movies.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I watched this yesterday and it was pretty boring, watchmen is an embarrassment to the superhero genre, the avengers is 1,000,000 times better.</p><hr><p><b>Paul</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Amazing movie. Easily Top 10 superhero movies of all time. They did their thing on this one, they made a movie for fans and film lovers, and not a summer blockbuster to make some quick buck.</p><hr><p><b>Peter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A rare movie these days, because one of the few that requires actual intelligent to appreciate the greatness of the dialogues and the complexity of the story best movie ever made, it's sad to see that some people will never get it though, as they prefer the cheap thrill of dumb Hollywood movies for retards.</p><hr><p><b>Joey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anyone that enjoys mindless "blow 'em up" garbage over real thought provoking material has no business even glancing at "Watchmen". Saying that you prefer "Transformers" or "The Avengers" just shows how stupid you actually are. If all you enjoyed about the film was Dr. Manhattan's big blue penis, you have serious issues. Get help. Go watch "Sex And The City 3:Carrie Gets A Hysterectomy". This was a fantastic film and the best adaptation of the original work that we could possibly get without making it 6 hours long. It had plenty of action. In fact, there were people that actually read "Watchmen" that complained about the film expanding the fight scenes too much just to keep the attention of idiots. I thought it was awesome and I can't wait to finally see the Director's Cut.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I watched this on demand yesterday and I ended up liking it, it was a lot more action oriented than the graphic novel was, but it doesn't beat the avengers though, the avengers is the best superhero movie ever. The reason why I gave watchmen a 9 is because they killed off Rorschach at the end, I really liked him the best.</p><hr><p><b>Brandon James Croker</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great script for, in my opinion, a very underrated movie. It is amazing how great the writing in this movie is. It's got the sophistication and cleverness of "The Dark Knight" and the excitement and thrill of "Schindler's List". A great classic. Just awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Best comic book ever written, and a fantastic movie. Though I d not like the part where Ozymandias dies in this draft, I like it better when he lives. The final version was certainly an improvement.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Even though I thought watchmen was a good movie, I think kickass is the better film, it too takes on the "what if superheroes were real" scenario but it's more fun and has a more over the top kind of nature.</p><hr><p><b>Miriam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant movie of a legendary graphic novel. It's a pity they couldn't include the other half of the story about the guy in the shipwreck that neatly draws metaphorical parallels with the main story, but the film would have been easily twice the size and many more people would have hated it. I don't know what people have against stories that require the audience to think. I can't wait to read this script. Thanks IMSDB.</p><hr></td>
