If I could give this a higher rating I would. I could watch all three movies over and over and never get tired.</p><hr><p><b>Arwenlas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever made!</p><hr><p><b>Smeagol</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Bestest movie ever</p><hr><p><b>junior</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>if i could sleep with these movies i would.. thats how much i love them ...uhhhhhhhhhh there so good why did god let my eyes watch this now ill never sleep always watching it .. then there special features....omg i gotta watch that rite now</p><hr><p><b>Aragorn!!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No comment. Just the best movie ever, there is nothing else to say about it!</p><hr><p><b>Legolas</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. I think it's the best movie of all three!</p><hr><p><b>Galadriel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wonderful! I loved the  script! It's about as close to the movie as you can get.</p><hr><p><b>strider</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Created by a genius (TOLKIEN) and directed by a genius (JACKSON).</p><hr><p><b>Gandalf</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If God wasn't my #1 then Lord of the Rings would be my God and I would worship it all day! There will never be anything that amounts to the perfected art of Tolkien and the gift the nerd Peter Jackson gave into creating the motion picture. As I am writing I am watching the scene where Gandalf has just fallen off the bridge and it goes into the slow motion silent scene and everyone is outside mourning. "Give them a moment for pity's sake". If there were an infinite number I would have chosen it for rating. Oh well.</p><hr><p><b>Obi-wan Kenobi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Agree, agree and again agree! This is one of my favorite movies. The comedy from Gimli is hilarious, "I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!" Awesome! And Helms Deep will forever be in the minds of war movie lovers. The small, tiny details in that battle are amazing. I recommend listening to the commentaries. They help the perspective immensely. But my favorite character has to be Eomer. Karl Urban is the best actor in Australia!</p><hr><p><b>Kj</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies ever! (the others being the fellowship and the return of the king).</p><hr><p><b>Eowyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie. Best ever made!</p><hr><p><b>Sahra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing! I absolutely love this movie, I love the acting and the music.</p><hr><p><b>The Balrog</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Since everyone seems intent on using LOTR names (except Obi-wan Kenobi who I guess must be slightly lost) I'll just have to be that most unspeakable monster the Balrog, as my rating is sure to spoil the love-in a bit. While I certainly didn't hate the LOTR films (in fact on the whole I quite enjoyed them), the idea that these are the best movies ever made is just completely wrong. Actually, it's just as wrong as the idea that the novel is the best book ever written. Those who hold these opinions, clearly need to watch a lot more films and read a lot more books. There's plenty far better ones out there.</p><hr><p><b>Hater of all LOTR haters</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What are you talking about? This is the best film ever, it was even rated best blockbuster film ever.</p><hr><p><b>Tash</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Lord of the Rings is one of the best movies ever! Best director and crew. Actors and actresses were all AWESOME. Couldn't be better!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie! Probably my favorite of the three. Now being that I'm a girl I have to say that I actually missed out on going to see a 1 1/2 hour "kiddie" flick to go see this movie because I liked the first one so much. Of course I knew I had to go see it since Orlando Bloom is freakin HOT. It had everything: action, humor ("would you like to me describe it to you or shall I find you a box"), and much more! I actually was surprised to see the rift between Legolas and Aragorn towards the end, it almost made me cry to see two friends, not to mention HOT guys, fighting.</p><hr><p><b>Eowyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie EVER! I could see it over, and over, and over. I was even Eowyn for Halloween! She's way cooler then Arwen! Plus Legols, Aragorn, and Eomer are soo Hot! Opps! Eomers my brother, Nevermind!</p><hr><p><b>Arwen Evenstar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is by far one of my favorite movies. The casting is superb and it just makes me feel all good every time I watch it!</p><hr><p><b>Cyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movies, but must say, number 2 and 3 happen to be my favs. I agree with the fact that they aren't the greatest movies or books ever made, but they are still good. 
I liked the characters Eomer, Théodred- Prince of Rohan, Boromir and Faramir. 
The casting was excellent and each actor suited their character perfectly.</p><hr><p><b>Hadir</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE LotR. Particularly The Two Towers. It is always hard not to cry when Haldir dies tho. Even reading the script! I LOVE LOTR.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the scenes in this movie reminded me of the of the scenes in Pirates III. When Gandalf and co are at Edoras and Gandalf is trying to free Theoden from Sarumans spell, Eowyn sees this and tries to stop it but Aragorn holds her back. But as the spell is broken Theoden slumps over and Eowyn frees herself from Aragorns grasp, forcing him to throw up his arm in surprise. In Pirates III when Will first tries to talk to Elizabeth she tries to leave but he holds her back and when she finally does leave he flails his arm up in the same way. Both trilogies are awesome. Orlando Bloom is so HOT in both of these trilogies.</p><hr><p><b>Sem</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The lord of the rings is the most beautiful film the story of cinema has ever seen. All other epic films I watched after LOR were senseless!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Okay I think I exaggerated with my above comment. In POTC 3 Will's arm flail wasn't as dramatic as Aragorns. It's because Will was mad when doing it and Aragorn was surprised. Both trilogies 10 out of 10. And Orlando will ALWAYS be HOT in both.</p><hr><p><b>Tina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think Peter Jackson really put his soul and mind in all the LOTR movies, he has a knack for recognizing cast/crew talent and a talent for attention to detail, his films are worthy of Tolkien's trilogy and puts them on an epic scale that everyone knows that Tolkien will enjoy watching if he was here.</p><hr><p><b>ICouldntDecideAName</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>In reply to The Balrog's comment, the number of books I have read must be in the thousands by now. I have not seen anywhere near so many films, but I have a lot of experience in fantasy books - and LOTR is definitely a classic. For once, the films are almost as good as the books - they didn't change them beyond recognition, and if anything, some of the bits they added make 'em better (Aragorn + Arwen). Peter Jackson has definitely made a wonderful film, and I look forward to watching The Hobbit - when it finally comes out!</p><hr><p><b>Steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>These movies are a crappy interpretation of the story, making so many ridiculous changes to the characters and plot that it has turned a brilliant epic into trite, simplistic, stereotypical, nonsensical swill for the masses. It is really a different story entirely. It is NOT The Lord of the Rings. Whenever the filmmakers have claimed to love the story, it is bullshit. If they could trash it the way they did, they hardly know it at all, and they just exploited it to make themselves a fortune.</p><hr><p><b>Faramir</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love these movies and the books even more. My favorite character is without doupt Faramir. Even though I was upset by the way they changed him in the movie, I think David Whenam did a perfect job. 
The part in the Grand Hall, when Pippin swears the oath, is one of my favorite parts. The displys of emotions on Mr Whenam's face are remakable. The words are so well spoken and the acting is superb. When he leaves you can see how hurt he is but how much he tries not to let it show by just the look of his back. If You shoud ever read this, Thank You Mr Whenam for what you have done. You are a magnificent actor, a role model for me as an actor</p><hr><p><b>Legolas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love these movies! They are the best I've seen in a while. My favorite character would have to be Legolas(he *is* extremely cute). Did you know that there is more fanfiction written about him than any other LotR character?</p><hr><p><b>Megan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE THESE THREE MOVIES! I've watched all these movies about a million times in the past six months. It's just one of those movie trilogies that you want to keep going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going. Legolas, Aragorn, Arwen, Arwens Dad, Borimir, Frodo, Pippin, Merry, Sam, Gandalf, and Gimlee are my Favorite characters. It was awesome when I first saw those movies. It was about SIX MONTHS AGO, and i've been watching them since. You need to see these movies if you haven't already. ENJOY.</p><hr><p><b>Gandalf tel' Celeb</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Out of the movies I love TT for its portrayal of gollum! Andy serkis is incredible! I love to imitate his voice, and I'm pretty good too, BUT I still like Fellowship the best.</p><hr><p><b>Marina</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Obviously the movie is fantastic. But this is not the script. This is an attempt to recreate the script by people who show an ignorance to the actual formatting. Action description is in the same margins as the dialogue AND encased in brackets. Parenthetical direction is also in brackets and with improper margins. Some direction is in the progressive present. Basically you can get a feel for the film, but if you're looking for examples of scripts do not pay any attention to this. The one for the fellowship however is in proper formatting and looks genuine. It is however (like most of them here), is in production stage formatting. Which isn't a hindrance in the least but if you're looking for examples while writing scripts it's important to note that in spec scripts there is no holding, no scene numbers and no camera directions.</p><hr><p><b>Gimli's Axe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Easily my favorite of the 3. Gimli is a gem of a character. A true warrior and comedic genius.</p><hr><p><b>Naughty little fly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I was a substance abuser, then I quit. These three movies got me through the hardest part of my withdrawl. As I was watching I felt a real connection with Gollum. These 3 have a very special place in my heart, always will have. The magnitude of this project is just mindblowing and the vfx, made the surreal real. And Gollum's answer to who he was "Cold be heart and hand and bone, cold be travellers far from home. They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.". Such poetry! Beautiful.</p><hr><p><b>DTG</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>You missed a bit of dialogue after Gollum was captured and agreed to take them to Mordor and before we first see The Uruk Hai with Merry and Pippin.</p><hr></td>
