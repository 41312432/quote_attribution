Thanks</p><hr><p><b>cat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I WOULD have to say that CONSTANTINE by far is the most amazing film i had ever seen...i've had people come up to me saying that this movie was "boring" but they also said they didnt understand well thats what happens when people dont pay attention!!    
i love johns tattoo's they are very cool and very well done..
also i got the DVD when it first came out .....</p><hr><p><b>Natalie F</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant!! Absolutley Brilliant!!

BEST movie I have seen all year.

SEQUAL SEQUAL!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Sam. S</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I mean what else do i have to say apart from 10 out of 10. </p><hr><p><b>sriyati</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I really enjoy it. It's all about  our life and our belief to the life after death. Simply, I like the story.</p><hr><p><b>Jeri</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>PERFECTION!
Bring on the Sequal!!!!</p><hr><p><b>new</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>sorry
</p><hr><p><b>Indie Brit</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Go and read the comics that this film is based on you will see why this "movie" version of it sucked. I mean I don't care how good Keanu Reaves looks in a black leather trench coat he was just plain wrong for the part!</p><hr><p><b>cikala suka</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I just can't understand why they chose to make a movie about John Constantine and then completely changed him. It's not like he's the one and only human dabbling in magic and the occult. They could have called it something different and been accused of ripping off a couple of themes but it would have been far removed enough to get away with it. If this film had been called Concannon about a 'plays by his own rules occult detective' called Jim Concannon sure the Hellblazer fans wouldn't have been happy but at least they wouldn't have sullied John' good name and there would have been a pop-corn munching average movie that didn't rile us so much to watch - and now us fans know that there will never be a movie of the 'real' Constantine.</p><hr><p><b>Dilay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>hey best movie ever</p><hr><p><b>JS</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
Best movie ever, really? 

Better than Casablanca? Better than Bridge on the River Kwai? Better than Midnight Cowboy? Better than The Graduate? Better than Raging Bull, Chinatown or Citizen Kane? Better than Schindler’s List? Better than Taxi Driver? Better than The Godfather? Better than Rear Window? Better than  Pulp Fiction? Better than Strangers on a Train. Better even than The Deer Hunter and On the Waterfront?

Although by definition I haven't yet seen Constantine - (I switched it off after ten minutes), I am now kicking myself that I missed "the best movie ever."


</p><hr><p><b>cheesecloth</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Worst movie ever. More background noise than film. K. reeves needs to stop making thisshit and return to film swhere he merely moans or sighs or surfs. Total waste of time, unless you need to clean up your apartment.</p><hr><p><b>farzad</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>well, I love it. however its concept is lead to some misunderstandings. by the way it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>JS is absolutely right. Casablanca, Scarface Lawrence of Arabia, Braveheart, Gandhi, Gone with the wind, Kramer vs Kramer, American History X, Pulp Fiction. They are all great movies, but that one here. The only way i can imagine Keanue signing that crap is, that was stoned or something like that. </p><hr><p><b>It Breaks Things</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Brain candy. Mindless fun. Not the best brain candy and mindless fun, but for what it is, it's pretty good. On the nicer side of average.
I'd like to also say that it is a bad, bad thing when the movie script is better than the movie.</p><hr><p><b>rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i LOVED it...i mean, yes i know the comic book hero is supposed to british and blond etc. but you gotta admit that the movie was gd...epspecially the special effects. But hey, if you haters of the movie think you can do a better job, i say go for it. If you can't then put up or shut up. (i don't mean to be rude in anyway...)</p><hr><p><b>Adric</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Definitely not the best or worst movie ever. The cinematography and visual effects were amazing, the story had some very intriguing elements, and some of the quirkier characters were great, but the story and the acting left something to be desired. After watching the deleted scenes, it was obvious that it could have been a much better movie if they'd worked a while longer on putting it together before shooting. To have shot at least 2 or 3 different scenes to fit in the lung cancer element is excessive and shows sloppy directing. 

As a personal aside, some of the more inaccurate religious elements bothered me, but only b/c I know how willing to believe some moviegoers are.</p><hr><p><b>k</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply amazing. Great characters and wonderful ending.</p><hr><p><b>J. MacKenzie</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>        Good script. The start of it seemed a little rushed though. Slapped together with scenes that don’t really feed the plot or develop characters beyond the superficial angsty hero, tough yet vulnerable female, quirky sidekick schticks. It panned out better in the last bit then I would have thought possible from the weak start though. 
	Got a soft spot for movies with the devil in them, so I am probably ranking this higher than it deserves.      </p><hr><p><b>Bripster</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The film wasnt bad, kinda patchy tho. Keanu Reaves had his usual role done well, but could have displayed SOME emotion!!</p><hr><p><b>.jbq</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>absolute waste of time. it was uninspiring, illogical (don't give me that crap about not paying attention), had too many poorly conducted "plot short cuts", leitmotifs that really didn't work, too much focus on unimportant events while way too briefly touching on important aspects (to show off sfx, on presumes), &c. and i don't understand why they have cut short the EXTREMELY few things they have taken from the comic books; usually such things are more elaborate and fancy than the original, but here it remains a cheap knock-off (in particular the devil-sequence - it both plays out so much better and is that much more intelligent and original in the comic "Dangerous Habits"). i saw it with an open mind, not wanting to have it destroyed by my love for the comic book, but i was extremely disappointed. I agree completely with whoever said that it should have been an original script that was merely inspired by Constantine, because, frankly, that's what it *is*. now it has ruined our chances of a "true" Constantine-flick. oh well...</p><hr><p><b>James Howelett</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I liked every part of the movie. It had traces o action compared to other Keanu films but hey the story was awesome and I'm waiting for the next part. John's way of life and style got me inspired bro.</p><hr><p><b>YNOT</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was alright... that's all. I think most of the votes before me have been sooo one-sided(one or ta' other)(btw me thinks(yes, 'me thinks') some of you may want to go back to school(do think that one over, k?)) :P</p><hr><p><b>ConstantineComicSucks</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The only reason you can possibly hate Constantine is because the comics. This is the greatest movie ever made. Go back to watching The Crow.</p><hr><p><b>JXL</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Sound advice since the Crow is a lot better :)</p><hr><p><b>youssra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Constantine is the best movie I've ever seen, people don't like the movie because they just simply don't understandd it! John has been to the hell. He sees demons and angels. He is an exorcist. What kinda emotions should he have yet? He always acts emotionlessly. That's why this role matched very well with him. Deal with it!</p><hr><p><b>Jesus Christ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I hear my name a lot in this movie. My father gets the cool scenes.</p><hr><p><b>Christian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Dear sweet lord this movie was amazing! I can only hope to be in his shoes. I only wish to find that verse he was reciting to that demon in the suite. I would definitely love to see this movie over and over.</p><hr><p><b>Stacey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I honestly think everyone bitching about K. Reeves are blind ignorant assholes. You all look for mirror image Hellblazer movies, but you all fail to see that this was never meant to be a mirror image movie. It was simply meant to capture the essence of John Consantine. A con with the worlds of heaven and hell against him, dying, who, while trying to save his own ass (yet again) realizes that this is bigger than him. You people going in there expecting to see Hellblazer on the screen are only shutting yourselves off from truly enjoying a good movie with amazing acting, themes, emotions and awesome hell effects. If you fail to open your eyes, you'll never see what's right in front of you. The only thing that I would have changed: I would have put the scenes of John's demon lover (you all "real fans" should know who) back in there, it would have just added a little something extra. I love it.</p><hr><p><b>Brandon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie.</p><hr><p><b>darren</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>If you know the Hellblazer comics (and I do) then you know what a huge let down this film is. Neo was a terrible choice for John and the whole cross gun shooting all the hell spawn was just awful. The books are much more subtle and creepy and John's power stems from manipulating other people to do the dirty deeds for him. Not to mention they forgot that he is blonde and British. To quote Keanu this film is "BOGUS DUDE!".</p><hr><p><b>Tony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was absolutely amazing. For all of the people that put low scores and said it was awful and that Keanu didn't fit the role you don't get it, when a comic book comes to life in a movie you have to change things. You have to alter the plot a little bit, you have to cast people who might not exactly look the part but when they are playing the part the attitude fits the role. Keanu was the best choice possible for this role his persona was what made him John Constantine. Just because he didn't have blonde hair doesn't mean anything. The film was absolutely excellent and the script was amazing as well.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A good movie.</p><hr><p><b>Vladimir</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The film was OK. It wasn't the best. Keanu Reeves could have put a bit more emphasis in what he does. None of you can spell SEQUEL. It's not that hard to understand the concept of the English Language.</p><hr><p><b>Zac</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>To tell the truth this movie was good but it pales in comparison to the comics, and they screwed up the character of Constantine. Other than the fact he displays little emotion usually, which makes it understandable why they wanted Keanu for the part. No, it isn't the best movie ever, but it was a good one. Besides, could always be worse. It could have been directed by Uwe Boll.</p><hr><p><b>Hames</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I haven't read the comic books, so I watched this film as just a film and I think it's pretty damn good. Angels, demons, a neverending battle for the planet, the occult, Christian mythology, Hell itself. I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen. Alright, so Keanu can't really act (he only has two facial expressions, after all), but the rest of the cast did really well, particularly Gavin Rossdale and Tilda Swinton. And Lucifer was brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Soheil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Such an excellent movie, I like it a lot!</p><hr><p><b>Ezgi</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Almost nothing original. Felt like watching an episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer or something like that. Such a waste of time for Keanu Reeves.</p><hr><p><b>annonomus</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The story line i think could have been better. I think the best thing about the hole thing was Gabriel though. I wish the bibil said more about him.....after i watched this movie, it made me pick up a bible for the first time and actually read a little. I was only trying to find out more about him though...</p><hr><p><b>It Breaks Things</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>It is a sad, sad thing when the script is better than the movie.</p><hr><p><b>RENThead Poet</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It was a pretty good movie. The storyline could have had a few changes and it could have replaced a couple actors, but it wasn't bad. It's great to watch when you're bored.</p><hr><p><b>taqokambatant</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Hey, this movie rocks.</p><hr><p><b>Dravin</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I am (to be honest) impressed and also shocked of what this movie contains .
The violence is okay, storyline is great, but the fact that one of the Archangels would become a traitor, now that is too much to handle for me. I mean don't put the Holy Book in the spotlight of shame, please! Don't play with religions okay! Who could think of something awful like that, you should be ashamed of yourself! Although I must say that a sequal of this movie would be great and smashing. I'm looking forward to it. Who's going to be next on Constantine's black list?</p><hr><p><b>Gharmos</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Constantine is such a great film, but I think it wouldn't have been great if Keanu's character wasn't written like that. His badass nature just makes the film awesome- example- Angela: "I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction?". Constantine: "Sure" *Points at the door*. Makes me laugh!</p><hr><p><b>shwan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'll remember this movie for very long time. It was great awesome film. I hope there is a sequel to this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Gamergrl</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I give a "10" to the script, but the movie sucked in comparison, so it knocked my rating down a couple pegs. If you've only watched the movie and haven't read the script READ THE SCRIPT! You're on the right page now, just scroll to the bottom, click on "Constantine" Script and start reading. You won't be disappointed. </p><hr><p><b>ladi</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie though the story line lacked certain originality when compared to matrix. Saving the world and stuff. Lucifer could have being made cooler though, the treachery of archangel Gabriel was superb. The role of Angela didn't suit Jenifer. Keanu played his role perfectly (I'm surprised it's questionable) less emotion is best in regards to good and evil wars.</p><hr><p><b>Siberia</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Lame movie, didn't read the comics so I don't care. Poor Keanu, now he's perpetually marked as Neo he won't ever be able to do anything different than shooting the hell off things *sigh*.</p><hr><p><b>Jason</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I liked it. In some ways the script is better than the movie. Yes the movie took shortcuts. In other ways the movie did things right. It's not an all time masterpiece. But I've watched it multiple times and no regrets. Ps oh and Keanu will always be Ted to me.</p><hr></td>
