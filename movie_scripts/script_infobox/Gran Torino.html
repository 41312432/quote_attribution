    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>ALFONSO</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've already seen the film. I saw it before it came to Spain (my country) and I absolutely loved it. I think it was one of my favorite movies in the last year. Clint Eastwood has created a character which put together some of his famous characters, thinking about how they could be at their last years alive. It's simply wonderful. Now I'm going to read the script because I want to read some of the good dialogues of the film again.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The dialogue is a bit lazy, as in the connections between the characters were sort of forced. Not realistic. It didn't capture the loneliness of Clint Eastwood's character or how that would lead him to overcome his deep-seated ethnic bias. The acting was bad, but you can tell it wouldn't have been believable with better actors. If you suspend your disbelief, it's a pretty touching movie. Good plot. Just could have used some work.</p><hr><p><b>Eleanor</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It is important to think of symbolism, and plot devices when approaching such a story. It is very well conceived, and, as the subject it tackles, takes on a very old school, classical, straight-forward, linear approach to tell its story, all of this in order to tell a story revolving around one central symbol.</p><hr><p><b>Cassandra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wonderful.  I haven't seen the film yet.  It really helps to be familiar with some of the casting decisions so you can 'see' the characters and 'hear' the voices as you read.  I look forward to catching the film now.  Reading the script ahead of time didn't ruin my anticipation at all.  Wonderful story</p><hr><p><b>Jon</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Walter cares but is too humble to take open credit for it.  
He sees a world that wants what he has more than who he is.  He sees a world bossing him around, even on his birthday.  He sees a world that ceases to take pride in itself for sake of others.  He sees the church reflective of this.
But Walter's care is willing to sacrifice self.  Concern battles apathy.  In the meantime, Walter discovers the church and neighbors cherish his welfare more than what they can get from him.  Hence, they become the worthy heirs of all he has.
Truly, there are Christ overtones in the film.
I think the camera work could have been a bit better artistically.  </p><hr><p><b>Lola</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>A lot of the scenes were simply too contrived for my taste. The racial slurs were so overdone, it wasn't funny. And why would a die-hard racist virtually commit suicide for people he only recently hated? Not what I expcted and not exactly a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Travis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Not surprising some people would find him a racist because he used slurs. He was a war vet that had biases from his experiences that in the end he saw were wrong. A racist is the bad guys in this story, the gang members, the ones that use any excuse to be violent and ignore their conscious. Look at their over all actions to understand the people, not just what is said.</p><hr><p><b>Robin Furtado</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I found this as one of the great movie which is all about racisim. The best learning what I got is" Just because someone is different, it does not mean he is wrong" and most of all about the cultural diferences, when Walt went to Tao house to have a beer. Culture is anunwritten rules of the social game. Overall fantastic but ending was beyond my expectation. Good job done by Clint Eastwood.</p><hr><p><b>Bruce P</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have watched the movie a couple of times and think the PC critics didn't get it. Possibly they didn't watch the ending? I wanted to look up the quotes from the scene with the three black guys. I noticed the original script was different from the movie. But got side tracked when Walt reads his horoscope on his birthday "Your birthday today. This year you have to make a choice between two paths. Second chances come your way. Extraordinary events culminate in what maybe an anti-climax.". The good script writers fit in some symbolic part that quite often gets overlooked by the viewers. I completely missed the significance of the horoscope when watching the movie. Walt finishes the scene with "What a load of crap". Classic Eastwood.</p><hr><p><b>Taner</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Ave watched the movie a couple of times and think the PC critics didn't get it.

Classic Eastwood.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie, the symbolism was astounding, it handles racism very well, in regards to Walt's past. The end is the ultimate twist and I loved it, sad, but the ultimate sacrifice symbolized the end of racism, metaphorically, we should all follow in Walt's footsteps and end racism, goodnight.</p><hr><p><b>Sue</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a story revolving around the transformation of a lonely, "set in his own ways" man into a deeply loved and cherished person because of his guidance and unwavering support. His acceptance of others created the catalyst of change which came from his own inner making and metamorphosis. His actions are the product of well thought out judgements from his life experiences remolded into pillars of strength. Many actions could have lead to his downfall in completing his mission, if he hadn't been enlightened by the love and concern shown to him by so many friends. Walt embraced all the painful and deeply ingrained life regrets residing in his heart and encased them into a bomb filled with self sacrifice and endearing love to save the people he now held dearly as his friends." Grand Torino" is an exceptional tale which needed to be heard.</p><hr></td>
