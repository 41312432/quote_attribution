    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>nightstalker</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the best movie ever by a million and terminator 3 sucks.</p><hr><p><b>ishaan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the awesomest movie but t3 does not suck it's good too.</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This film is just so mind blowing I cannot even talk! Thank you James C! As for T3, at some point I wish someone could just tell the guy "hey, you're not James Cameron, so why don't you be a big boy and call it a day". Yes the chick is hot and worth the price of admission, but as I feared the image of the terminator would be sullied by a lazy filmmaker who relies on CGI too much. Whatever happened to stuntment who kicked the crap out of each other to get the shot the film needs, watching 2 cartoon versions of Arn and Kris beat each other up was insulting!</p><hr><p><b>KILLER</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Terminator 2 is the best movie ever made. Terminator 3 was ok but not as good as the second. I hope that they make a 4th and final part, which will be better than all of the others. Also I hope that Arnie plays a part in the final Terminator movie thats if they decide to make it. Also that there should be more body count than the other 3 terminators put together and more bloody scenes.</p><hr><p><b>Bill</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Terminator 2 is the best damn movie that has ever been created and ever will be created. Terminator 1 is good, it is what the terminator is all about, killing. Terminator 3 is ok but it has been taken too far with all the special effects, it's not as believable as the other two. Terminator 2 kicks all of em!</p><hr><p><b>hazzar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mind blowing. What a way to describe it, if there is a better film than Terminator 2 I ain't seen it. It is immaculate in every way. If it was only being shown once more in the entire world I would give my life to see it, because what's the point in living in a world without it?</p><hr><p><b>maf</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>T2 was mind-blowing at the time, back in 1991. I remember seeing it at the flicks at least half-a-dozen times. For me it hasn't aged all that well. It's still extremely entertaining and exciting where it should be, but many of the dialogue bits in between the action seem more forced and the acting poor. Sarah's lesbo-icon speech about men not understanding a growing baby in a woman is especially cringe-worthy. The extended version of T2 is good, expanding on some important scenes (the operation scene on Arnie's head, explaining his sudden desire to learn is good); but the Terminator's change from killing machine to protector is still disappointing - and the "I need a vacation" line is just as embarrassing. Robert Patrick's T-1000 makes up for any of the T-101's shortcomings though (he's excellent). Oh and I still love those opening battle scenes in the future. So overall, I really like T2. It's just not as cool as it used to be for me when I was 17 back in 1991 :)</p><hr><p><b>Saravan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>T2 is the best movie ever made. Arnold did not fit the role in t3, as he looked old. Maybe a CG rendered Arnold would help making T4.</p><hr><p><b>paul gumbleton</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's a mind blowing movie that I enjoy watching every time it's on. I like all Schwarzenegger movies so I liked it!</p><hr><p><b>chaitanya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best ever action movie created in history of movies. James Cameroon did a splendid job.</p><hr><p><b>VegEdGoku</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It could be a better movie. For me, it's still a best "Terminator" movie of three. I think that fourth will be second best or best movie of "Terminator", especially if a director would be Stephen Chow.</p><hr><p><b>alvini</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Like the way, the terminator was changed from a bad guy to being the good guy in the end.</p><hr><p><b>Jon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best action sci fi movies ever made, and for sure one of the best sequels ever, but this movie was more of a realization and advancement of the original films concepts and ideas than just a simple sequel. This is what we wish all sequels were like. An action packed movie that is also very intelligent. A very tough movie but very human as well. All 4 leads- Arnie, Linda Hamilton, Ed Furlong, and Robert Patrick did an excellent job with their respective characters. James Cameron has his own unique script style of course, but the movie on screen is still this many years later as action packed and well made.</p><hr><p><b>Ezra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was weird, the scene when the T-800 falls into the lava. Those few added lines... "Are you afraid?" "Yes.." That changes it a lot. I'm not sure if for better or worse. But that scene gets me every time, Eddie did a good job there.</p><hr><p><b>derbling</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>An interesting script to read for everyone who appreciates this movie's grace and wants to understand more of it; comprehend the way how it became what it is today and always will be. As to the lines in the final scene in the steel mill which didn't make it into the movie's final form, I believe when the team were at that state of progress of the film, jim and the rest must have realized that it had to be clear to the viewer that the terminator was afraid- even without him saying so explicitly. There seem to be some more lines that were shortened even despite their epic meanings. I think the team decided to deliver as much as possible by strong acting, perfect lighting, settings and so on. I was happy to read comments like the one from hazzar here and learn that I am not alone worshiping this masterpiece.</p><hr><p><b>GG</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of those movies you never forget seeing on the big screen- I remember that night vividly and being taken to another world for T2. Easily one of the best action movies of ALL TIME and there's not a wasted minute in this movie. Great performances all around a very tight and wonderful script. I love T2.</p><hr><p><b>slacky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>By far this could be one of the best ever Sci-fi blockbuster sequels. Arnie says a lot more as the T-850 (as his role is a goodie), it is a lot more humourous than the dark, yet still impressive first installment and Sarah Connor has a son called John who is quite cool. Even though the third was nothing near the first two, it is still a good film. The only other James Cameron films I've seen are Titanic and The Abyss which are different than The Terminator films anyway. Hope you enjoy T2, unless you've already seen it.</p><hr><p><b>Presidente</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best sci-fi movie of all! I often rewatch it with pleasure. P.S. Arnie in T2 is not a T850, he's a T800 v2.4. It can be seen on a deleted scene where John and Sarah pull his CPU from the skull (search on youtube). When they reconnect the chip, Arnie turns on and its HUD shows "T800 model 101 v2.4". T850 instead is the good terminator from T3 and it's a slightly improved version over T800, with 2 fuel cells instead of one.</p><hr><p><b>Kastin Valaut</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome MOVIE. T3 was okay but not as good as T2. I shall always watch this one over and over again. T1 was really what started the Terminator hype. SPOILER ALERT: Arnie is not in T4 it's just a cgi of him and you only see him for like 10 seconds.</p><hr><p><b>Justin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The ending in this script proves that James Cameron didn't intend for Terminator to continue beyond part 2. I saw Terminator 1 when I was about 10 years old and 2 years later, Terminator 2 came out. So I saw both of these movies within their intended time frames. Then Terminator 3 came out. Naturally, I was shocked because I had assumed that T2 was the end of the story, but I went and saw it anyway, because it's Terminator. About an hour into the movie, I was convinced that what I was watching was nothing more than the studio flexing its legal muscle and just using its ownership rights to milk a great franchise for more money. The story didn't make sense at all, being that everything and everyone involved in the creation of SkyNet was destroyed and no traces remained. All loose ends were tied at the end of T2, and yet somehow everything continued as if nothing had even happened. By any other name, T3 would have been a decent generic action movie but as a Terminator film it failed miserably, in my opinion. The fact that James Cameron wasn't involved with it at all just further solidifies my opinion that the Terminator story ended with 2. T3 was just a mess riddled with plotholes and convoluted storylines and overly exaggerated explanations as to how everything was able to continue. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed in the film. Aside from the fact that it feasibly wasn't supposed to exist, it just didn't stand up to the great milestones that T2 had set. Terminator Salvation was even more disappointing than T3. I wasn't impressed with T3, but at least it still followed the classic Terminator formula (Terminator and Protector) while Salvation played out more like a high tech war drama that could have been named anything else and would have been okay. But again, as a Terminator movie it failed. Terminator 1 and 2 are some of my favorite movies of all time. The story telling, dialogue, and action are all amazing. The visual effects were great as well, and I'm glad that Cameron didn't go overboard with the computer stuff. He used the CGI for a purpose (T-1000 morphing) and not just to make everything look super shiny. Terminator 1 and 2 will always be the only REAL Terminator movies in my book. Terminator 3 and Salvation can go to hell.</p><hr><p><b>rostien</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my most favorite films of all time, and like some people on here what an earth was t3 about. The biggest mistake about t3 is the women terminator. In terminator 2 when john is talking to the terminator about the liquid metal t1000 he says ''why don't he just become a bomb or something to come and get me''. and terminator explains that he can't do that because guns and bombs contain chemicals. So how in t3 does the women have a flame thrower BUILT on to her arm, fuel has chemicals. And if the reason for this is that she can make chemicals then not only does it make the film worse she could have just turned into a bomb to get cover.</p><hr><p><b>Darthvid</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great script. Too bad Terminator 3 was cartoonish garbage, this was a great script & film. They ruined the franchise with the next two installments. This is how you write a screenplay.</p><hr></td>
