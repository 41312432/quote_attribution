But I hope that reading of the script will be more funny!</p><hr><p><b>Brianna</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought that Tristan and Isolde was somewhat cliche at times, but it was moving. The ending wasn't stereotypical at all. It surprised me and I liked that.</p><hr><p><b>carrie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was rather good.</p><hr><p><b>sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the story! The book is a little better in some ways, but this was an excellent movie.</p><hr><p><b>Lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie! It was not stereotypical at all. It was so sweet and done really well. I agree that I think the book is a little better, but this is an awesome job.</p><hr><p><b>Faith</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This movie was unbelievable. Like every movie, it did have some weak points where you lose your interest. Other than that, it was incredible, it captured the exact emotion you feel once in love. The whole shebang, this is a great movie to watch when you feel like crying. The love between Tristan and Isolde is so strong and everlasting that it will leave anyone who watches it in craving for that kind of love.</p><hr><p><b>Charlotte</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Cliche. Enough said.</p><hr><p><b>love.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was a perfect love story.</p><hr><p><b>Believe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This has to be, by far, my favorite movie I've seen! I loved it. It never lost my interest. I also agree with faith that anyone who watches it will be left craving that kind of love at the end of the film.</p><hr><p><b>Faithe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love that movie. It was a dramatic and forbidden love that they had. That was what I thought made the movie great.</p><hr><p><b>emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best romance movie I've seen yet. It keeps you wanting more and more, there's no end to the intense drama and love between tristan and isolde. I literally cried. Of course if you don't like romance there's plenty of action in there as well.</p><hr><p><b>tricia novakowski</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought that the movie was great. Tristan and Isolde's love story was very intense but it was sad that they did not wind up together in the end. I wish they would have wound up happily together and married, even though it did end the way I think it should have but can't change that now can I!</p><hr><p><b>Rosie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A beautiful, moving love story that will never grow old!</p><hr><p><b>mary</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It made me fall apart.</p><hr><p><b>stevie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was so full with love and I nearly cried.</p><hr><p><b>madison</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I agree with faith, it was wonderful. Their love was everlasting, it was a great movie. And how about that james franco, he's cute. Though the book was slightly better, the movie was heartwarming and as faith puts it love craving.</p><hr><p><b>ash uh LEE!GH</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. James Franco is not only cute, but frekkin sexy as a mofo. I'm going to be honest, I never cried too much at the end of any movie. Where the heck did Isolde go? Gah, it drives me crazy thinking of where she went after he died.</p><hr><p><b>jada</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A real great film. A lovestory every young girl would have want to have. But nevertheless we live in an age where this kind of real love is fade away. Because of that reason such tremendous films have to be made in order to remind us what LOVE is.</p><hr><p><b>Brashen</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>The film sucked, you lose interest early in it, it was too slow. Sure it was a love story, but it was a crap one. Nothing was believable in it. It was too long and drawn out for the type of obvious ending. Reminded me of a cross between titanic and gladiator for some reason. Oh yea that's right, it's because the main character died in the end. To say it was set in a time of war, the fight scenes were rubbish. But I noticed the female critics loved it. God if a guy took you to watch that, I bet he was bored out of his head.</p><hr><p><b>Nicole</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>By far one of the best love stories out there. The movie furthered my interests in the legend. Definitely well written by Dean Georgaris.</p><hr><p><b>---</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply amazing. You have to understand the time period and the context I find to fall completely in love with it though.</p><hr><p><b>Olivia</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Tristan and Isolde was such a dramatic love story that just touched many peoples hearts. Even though the ending was kind of obvious, but I loved it. With the tragic ending and beginning, just made everything match. One without the other would just make the movie so uneven. Tristan wouldn't be able to take anything.</p><hr><p><b>Candice</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie. It made me cry. Throughout the entire film, the person I care about most was on my mind and that made it even better. I thought the casting was great and the dialogue was catchy. I had to go look up some of the quotes and I intend on buying the book Isolde was reading from. This movie had so many great themes. I am in love with it.</p><hr><p><b>Savannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Well; I think most movies have a balance, if it's sad or devastating throughout the movie, it usually has a happy ending to balance it, or a happy movie, sad ending. But this was sad all the way through, and I like how it was different, and James Franco was brill.</p><hr><p><b>Jynka</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>So, what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic and I fell in love with this movie.  I'm so in love with it that I watch my favorite scenes everyday before I go to bed and have already memorized the dialogues.  I paraticularly loved the dialogue "I have not been naked with a man for 15 years".  Sounded so cute and funny!  Anyway,  James Franco and Sophia Myles were so good in this movie.  They have wonderful chemistry. </p><hr><p><b>Morgan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Okay, so I come from a very different backround, of different races and everything. I was actually told this story about Tristan and Isolde. The relatives in my family that told me this story to me in the German form, which is Tristan und Isolde, this was the title of the original play/opera and script. It simply just translates to Tristan and Isolde. Anyway, a lot of people wonder, what happened to Isolde after the death of Tristan, well it's a myth so a lot of people make up their own ending. On all the research I did on old folktales or folklore people always wrote that Isolde lived a pretty descent life after Tristan, some say she was actually pregnant with Tristan's baby at the time of his death, others say she died of a broken heart about a year after his death. It was really meant for young listeners to make up their own ending. Also, it says that Tristan was buried under a willow tree then Isolde was buried next to him and someone planted another willow tree. The two willow trees intertwined and were intertwined for a very long time, then one day, the trees just disappeared. The tree stumps weren't even there so obviously no one cut them down. Anyway I know this was long, but I love showing my love for Tristan and Isolde, and it always tells a great message.</p><hr><p><b>Kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I actually just finished watching this movie again and wanted to check out some of the text that was a little hard to understand. Some of the lines don't match up exactly but regardless, I think this is a really powerful flick. Period pieces like this are for a very specific audience and I almost always enjoy those set in Arthurian times, this movie being a favorite. Unlike a lot of "love stories", Tristan and Isolde is based on a legend from the 12th century (though text was said to be discovered from the 5th/6th century). written way before Romeo & Juliet and even pre-Lancelot/Guinevre. This isn't a story about huge proclimnations of love. There is no grandstanding or epic speeches of war and strife. I like that its simply two people, in impossible circumstances, who feel real emotions. Guilt, shame, joy, love and, of course, loss. I thought it was beautifully shot and really enjoyed the two leads, as well as the supporting players. It's tragic, heartbreaking but it's also so much more.</p><hr><p><b>Stephen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A wonderful movie about forbidden love. The aspect that really gets to me is the relationship between Mark and Tristen. They seem to imply a growing hatred for Mark emanating from Tristen, as he watches his true love play her role as his wife. The love that he feels for her forces him to despise Mark, which definitely demonstrates his superior love for her. Excellent cast. Rufus Sewell redeemed his image after A Knight's Tale. Mark Strong played the Knave beautifully. Overall, two thumbs way up.</p><hr><p><b>Richard</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I too felt left hanging at the end since it contained no reference to Isolde's life after Tristan died and since the film made you care about the characters. You were kind of left hanging. I wonder why Isolde choose not to stay with Mark her husband, he was a good man and a gentleman but I guess her love for Tristan prevented that. I just assumed she went back to her home and lived out her life there but many other idea about her life after Tristan could be imagined too. Above all I wish all of us would have this kind of love in our lives.</p><hr><p><b>Stephen</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Oh, what a slow moving bag of crap. She is a liar. He is a liar. They have no loyalty to anything except their respective crotches. A large portion of the movie is spent showing her having sex with her lover or with her husband then her lover and again with her husband. The king is stupid not to realize what is going on in his house, his forest and the old castle. It is a wonder she did not get spider bites on her butt. This in no way represents true love. It is two horndogs lying and not keeping their pants on.</p><hr><p><b>Lacemaker427</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Typo: In the last 2 paragraphs, Castle D'or is written without the apostrophe. Having not read the entire transcript, I can't state that it was the only time it was spelled wrong. It's not a big problem, but since proofing is my life, I felt compelled to put the comment here. What a life!/-:.</p><hr></td>
