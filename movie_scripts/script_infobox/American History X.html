The blak/white thinking for Derek is the past, in the movie the past is presented in black and white. The present is presented in Colour. I found this metafor really interesting, and concerning the end: I loved it. If Danny survived I would have given this movie seven stars. But with this ending it deserves eight. </p><hr><p><b>TH</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The movie is great but the script here on the website ain't the correct version that was used in the movie.
does anyone know where I can find the exact movie script?</p><hr><p><b>Bird</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What do you mean the ending wasn't realistic? The ending is what made the movie man "hate is baggage" and it was proven at the end of this great film, and yes I want to see tha actual movie script not this older version of it. If anyone knows how to get the final script let me know.</p><hr><p><b>atb</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This was a kick ass movie but the ending really sucked. Everything else was great.</p><hr><p><b>xShaex</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of my absolute favourite movies, I love it. The script on this site was different from the movie but I liked both! I heard there was an alternative ending where Derek stands in the mens lavatory after Danny is killed and starts shaving his head. I do prefer the ending in the movie, I am happy they chose that one. I love this movie and Danny/Edward Furlong is hot!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>That alternative ending would have been visually dramatic but would have been completely out of character for Derek, who was a thoroughly reformed character. Derek was highly intelligent and a purist in whatever school of thought he subscribed to, be it racism or anti-racism. He never did anything by halves. But also, he would never yo-yo from one set of principles to another and back again. His transformation was painstaking and systematic. Once he'd seen the folly of his ways, there would never be any going back. The ending we have is poignant and powerful enough, the alternative might have been a bit silly. The scene where he is in the shower and covers the swastika with his hand is a scene so highly charged with the emotion of regret, that you as the viewer almost feel a hole opening in your heart. It's where Derek's humanity should have been from the start.</p><hr><p><b>Bryant</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The ending sucks. That's just how this world works though. In all the good movies (American History X, Romper Stomper, Mississippi Burning, and Jasper, Texas, among others) the white race eventually loses. That's how this world is these days, based on racial equality. Phooey!</p><hr><p><b>Samantha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was great but the ending sucked, the little thug came up and shot Danny. I mean Danny was willing to change and too bad we couldn't see him change. Take it from me a half black half white girl, the whites and blacks both had good reasoning. Right?</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Bryant, you might want to clarify your comment before someone takes it the wrong way and accuses you of being a racist. 

I'm hoping your vitriolic little message is the result of imprecise and clumsy language, and nothing more. It certainly sounds to me like you're spouting poison on this messageboard, so please, so that we can give you the benefit of the doubt, clarify. </p><hr><p><b>Heather</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. Nobody can watch it, and not feel the hatred and pain felt by each character. Danny (Edward Furlong) is right. "Hate is baggage". And the ending proves that. What goes around comes around, and I think the ending of American History X plainly shows that. I don't think that "the ending sucks" as most of you do. It makes the movie, and it's so unexpected. I also read about the "alternate ending", but it's not true. It was never filmed, however it was an idea. I think that the ending as it is is powerful enough and the message about the effects of racism show through dramatically. If I could, I'd give this movie an 11 =).</p><hr><p><b>Fay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Bryant is 100% correct, there is no need to recant his comment.  Anyone who wants to view that post as racist is only seeing the world through ignorant eyes.  As for the script, the alternative ending would have only been an exclamation point on an already incredible film.</p><hr><p><b>Nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie offers an in depth illustration of the psychology of how a person can become lost in the heat of hatred, and the consequences it brings. Derek, the charismatic neo nazi group leader, lands himself in jail after a brutal murder. While in jail, he himself becomes the minority as he and his small group of whites are surrounded in a sea of blacks and mexicans. Living like this, Derek soon sees the many holes in his skin head beliefs and learns the truth of white supremacy. Upon his release, he attempts to save his brother from a similar fate of prison by changing his beliefs, but it's too late. From the gang rape, to the black man's head being split open on a curb, to the murder of Derek's brother, this movie leaves nothing out and will change your view of humanity.</p><hr><p><b>Kylla</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This was one of the best movies of all time. As far as the ending goes, it wasn't amazing but it definitely didn't suck.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Fay, to quote Bryant: "That's how the world is these days, based on racial equality. Phooey!" I originally asked Bryant to clarify that message but perhaps you would be so kind; he simply hasn't bothered his arse to do so. For anyone with an elementary grasp of English, that  comment comes across very badly indeed. So what exactly is Bryant 100% correct about, Fay? I'm obviously too ignorant to understand. 

</p><hr><p><b>Jaime</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can anyone give me a reason of this "suckness" about the ending? Which is the alternative one? Great film indeed.</p><hr><p><b>taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best films created. I have watched this film numerous times, and I grasp the concept of the film better each time. "We are not enemies but friends- We must not be enemies" as the great Abe Lincoln says at the end of the movie. For all of the critics that claim the end "sucked", I would stop being so ignorant to the overall vibe of the film. If you indeed liked the movie, you would understand that this was the best possible ending to put on a movie which preaches that hate is indeed baggage. Part of the reason this movie was so good is because it pounds these ideas into your brain with graphic representations. The racism portrayed by the curbing and grocery store scene, the enlightenment of Derek in the shower scene and the consequences of Dereks behavior in the final scene. This is what indeed makes the movie.</p><hr><p><b>cromina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. But I think the script in here is a little different to the original movie. Don't you think?</p><hr><p><b>aleshia jajo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of my favorites but the script is different from the movie! But it still made me cry!</p><hr><p><b>Frederick</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Yes I do think it was different from the original scripts, in fact the main introduction was more prolific than what you see in the movie. The contents were greatly spoken and performed. More, you see prevalent ideas of hatred toward immigrants and their botheration in American society; real. I think it was overall good but it needed a better conclusion nevertheless.</p><hr><p><b>Mathew</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Bullshit, peace-loving proselytic propaganda perpetuated by the one-track cultural movement of modern society in the U.S.. When is this crap ever going to end? No man is created equal! We are all different and have various potential values to society. When we embrace our differences and stop teaching our children that we are all the same, then we will learn to compliment each other for our own, individual, qualities. Screw this McDonalds loving, Beneton celebrating, Mickey Mouse Disney Small World Bullshit. Men are not meant to be at peace with each other. We kill each other beacause life realized long before us that resources are limited on this planet, and the same goes for the Universe. We should embrace our fighting spirit and competitive nature. Harness what has made us who we are and take it out to every other civilization in this Galaxy and every other. Show the rest of the Universe this world is ours, before another civilization makes us their bitch in the shower. You wanna get mankinds ass raped by another species, then love bullshit movies like this that promulgate peace, love, happiness and stagnation. Otherwise keep on fighting and may the strongest men survive!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Hey Matthew, so you're basically saying that you advocate war and prejudice, that you want to see mankind divided rather than united, and are all in favour of genocide and ethnic cleansing too, by the sounds of it.  Only a film as controversial as this, that deals in such a brutal fashion with such an uncomfortable subject, could bring total nutcases like you and Bryant out of the woodwork, to spout your rancorous propaganda in public. People with opinions like yours give the Dalai Lama sleepless nights. Besides all that, you seem to have missed the whole point - that, issues aside, this is a bloody excellent powerful film. </p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>P.S: Matthew, sorry to be a pedant but I think you'll find that 'compliment' is an expression of praise and 'complement', a thing that completes, was the word you were after!  
 </p><hr><p><b>Emphinix</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was a great movie. Powerful and very well written, it tells us in the end how hate and anger can drive you through the wrong path of life, even death itself. Most Neo-Nazi skinheads still exist, but they will never ever rise to power again as many people who don't support them say. It's better to be united rather than being divided by a philosophy of hate, anger, racism, war and prejudice. This is an excellent powerful film, although with some scenes that were totally disturbing. </p><hr><p><b>Person</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mathew, you call this movie bullshit and you say no man is created equal. That was not the overall point of the movie. It's trying to show that life is too short to be pissed off all the time and that we should appreciate everyone for their different characteristics and not to have prejudice.</p><hr><p><b>Foster</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is brilliance at its best no question about it.</p><hr><p><b>Jenna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever. You could not portray the truth of what American culture has become any better.</p><hr><p><b>Barry</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this script was absolutely incredible. I think the storyline is very original and was shot perfect. I think this movie shows how people and the modern day culture we live in can be so easily manipulated.</p><hr><p><b>Mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best film I've ever watched. In touch with reality, and the way the film was structured was simply brilliant. The ending was a shame, because it would have been nice to see the change in Danny. I can watch that film over and over again.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The way the scene resorts to black and white gives the Target Audience the obvious point of view that it is past tense this film noir technique has been used effectively by Tony Kaye which sort of provides a definition into the transformation of a Racist Skinhead into a sympathetic rehabilitated prisoner of hate and anguish. In my personal opinion I feel that Edward Norton indefinitely plays two separate characters one a young foolish but ruthless raciest and when the film resumes to colour it tells us that he is a sympathetic loving brother and family man who is eager to make up for his past wrong-doings and escape the life which he once had the film seems to have an abrupt ending which is good in fact, this film needed an ending like this in order for the audience to relate to racism as an everyday occurrence and in order to deal with this people must be open and be gracious to the fellow man despite whatever race they are, it not only benefits society but everyone can live in peace. Obviously there would be violence that is a given, but if everyone took note of this film their would be a lot more equality in the world. Great film, "Hate is Baggage".</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I studied this movie for my HSC. It is so moving and the only one of it kind. It deals with so many issues. If you ever get the chance to study it in depth I reccomend you do.</p><hr><p><b>American Christian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was a terrific movie. The end was sad but proves Derek's point that he was making throughout the movie. This film relates a lot to real life. I am a member of the A. See. D (Anglo Christian Disciples/ In no way a Nazi organization) and this movie gave a fair representation of what we believe in and that I appreciate. American History X shows a lot of the problems we face today as Americans. My friend was killed by a black gangster for $40. 00 a few years ago when he was going to visit is family for Christmas. I hope this movie has allowed people to see things from a different point of view. I loved the point Derek made in the movie about immigration. The school where I attend is over ran by black and Mexican gangs and that is one of the reasons I started the ACD. That doesn't make me a hateful person though as you're probably thinking. I just believe America is in need for a major change. I fear that if something isn't done soon, Danny's fate could be the same as all of ours as Americans. I give this film a 10 out of 10 no question. Remember that Derek changed his thoughts after his involvement with prison scum Nazi's who are in no way true Americans. That is why they were in prison. Derek's imprisonment was a different story because Derek was in my eyes, a noble and patriotic man. You may disagree and that's your right but this is how I feel and what I believe in so please, don't make any grade school remarks by calling me racist or whatever you may call me. This is in no way meant to offend any non-white people. If I have offended anyone, I am sorry.</p><hr><p><b>Kass</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mathew makes baby Jesus cry. Nietzsche was a fool Mathew. Sure he had some good ideas, but they were buried under a large amount of crap. This was a wonderful movie. Rent or buy it.</p><hr><p><b>Alan Bennett</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mathew (1 out of 10 ): above is an example of a 'scumbag', that has, bizarrely for one of its tiny cranial capacity, thought itself to type. Ignore its moronic drivel, as it will probably be run over or beaten to death eventually, hopefully sooner rather than later.</p><hr><p><b>Jay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is is great movie. Will it shake the world? NO IT'S A MOVIE.</p><hr><p><b>Krystal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of those that you can't watch and not be affected, for theatre we have to perform a dramatic scene from a movie, and we chose American History X, the scene at the dinner table with Murray. I do not want to misquote it, so if anyone knows where I can find the script used in the movie, please let me know. It upsets me when people only refer to the points of moving that are "cool" is the curb-stomping scene, and the robbing of the store. They miss the point of the film. And as for the ending, yes, it sucks that Danny dies, but really to have it any other way, wouldn't create as big of an effect. They are showing that change takes time, and with that comes sacrifices and effort. Yes, it would have given Derek an excuse to become racist again, but instead his character grew. Racism as a whole is not personal against you, but your ethnicity. And that is what Derek learns in jail, when he befriends a black man, who we learn basically saved his life. Many people who are racist hate everyone of one, or more, ethnicities and won't give anyone a chance.</p><hr><p><b>prince</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I do agree that the ending was sad but as a whole of the movie it was THE nicest movie I've ever watched. Danny was going to give his term paper to the principal about his brother who finally changed and got out of all of white gangs (although he was their leader). I think that they shot danny because his brother and the shit he pulled on them and not because of the stupid event that happened in the bathroom just because he helped the kid defend himself. I rate this movie a 10 because it is really touching. And this is how you can tell whether it's a good movie at the end. But then again. The ending makes the movie a better whole. I mean it fills the movie. I am trying to look for the conclusion danny said in his term paper, the quote he invented.</p><hr><p><b>kaboosh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Prince the quote is one from Abraham Lincoln's First Inaugural Address.</p><hr><p><b>Austriangirl</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I read all your comments and even my english is not the best I think I got the most. I agree, this movie is great! I am a fan of Edward Norton because he is really such a great actor, I think one of the best Hollywood has today. I am from Austria, I don't think I know a lot more about the second worldwar than you people in America, but maybe a bit. The War was (thank god) long over before I was born, but my grandmother lived to this time, she lost her father, her 16 year old brother, her baby brother and her grandmother during this time. She doesn't often talk about it, she was only a little girl when it ended. This movie again shows how easy it is to manipulate people. You americans are in a war right now, stop it, it only costs pain and it's no solution. No one is better than other people just because of the color of his skin, there wouldn't be a problem if we humans wouldn't make one out of it. Everyone who knows that is a lot better than everyone who is racist. 
Again to the film: I loved to watch it. The end, to be honest I am not sure if I get it the right way, but to this time I was thinking Derek is going to be shot, this thought makes me kind of nervous during the end of the movie and then Danny was shot and you know, it was so sad on one side but on the other I was kind of relieved that Derek would survive and I think this scene makes the movie complete, it just fits in. (PS: I hope this comment is understandable and I haven't done too many mistakes).</p><hr><p><b>TW</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies ever made. It is precise on its views and beliefs about everything. Edward Norton did an awesome job with his character and made everything he said seem completely real.</p><hr><p><b>Anthony P.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A very good movie indeed. Bird thanks for sticking up for the ending I thought it was reasonable for that to happen. Austirangirl sorry about your grandmother, I'm with you on the getting out of war part. WAR IS HELL, so is racism.</p><hr><p><b>SonderKommando</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>You are all brainwashed. Did anyone actually SEE and WATCH this movie?  Who was getting ready to beat up the white kid in the bathroom before Danny stepped in? Who lost the game on the basketball court, then tried to rob Derek as a retaliation? Who shot Danny and killed him in the bathroom?  All the things Derek said on the TV interview, at the dinner table, and before the restructuring of the beaner store is TRUE. Look it up.  The perpetual victim crap minorities play is old news.  Derek should have been killed because he turned his back on his own kind. I like how you sheeple see what you want to see.  If the FBI actually realsed the REAL crime reports for the year, it would make your head spin. Turn on the Jew Tube and watch who is doing all the violent crime.  </p><hr><p><b>Kyle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well I think what Bryant said was racist at all! He is right. That is how our country is turning out. It is all true, nothing is going to change. It is because more and more of the "minorities" are coming into our country, and there is nothing we can do about it. Ever since what Lincoln did, they have more rights, and people think that everything will be okay. I am not trying to be racist, but whenever someone says something like what Bryant said, people automatically say they are racist, and frankly, I don't see a problem with it. Every day, more and more people get murdered. Most of them buy minorities. Yeah white people do kill other people. The other day, two black people, killed two other people in front of a bar for some stupid reason, nothing is going to change.</p><hr><p><b>TS</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A lot of people don't like this ending but I think it is more to reality. Not every story ends happy, it is not always as easy as "I'm gonna change.. bam I changed". I wish they would have made a second one where Der has to take care of the old gang shit and poetically in the run gets revenge for his little bro and ends up all better just like things were supposed to go. But that is not life, life is a balance of happy, mad and depressed. Even the people with the most money are miserable, while the people who are poor make do and are at least happy. I think happy comes before money for me and I wish that this world all might see each other that way soon. There are 2 sides to every race, good and bad.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Re: Kyle and SonderKommando, forgive me if I'm stating the obvious here, but aren't all Americans descended from immigrants? How then can you attempt to blame the influx of foreigners for the ills of your nation? In fact, the very concept of a foreigner is irrelevant to the United States. Only native American Indians are entitled to bemoan the historic invasion of their land. So leave your rancorous propaganda at home.</p><hr><p><b>Vanessa</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Hey Mathew, sorry to say, but your ignorant ramblings are not only misspelled (proving that you don't pay much attention to detail) but are also utterly mistaken. All humans are genetically 99.9% identical, save for that 0.1% difference which is attributed to the type of melanin (proteins which create our skin color, thereby offering sun protection-there are two types phaeomelanin and eumelanin). That's a paltry and inconsequential distinction. As for the film, it was interesting enough, I actually dislike films that deal with racism, only because I feel that they are always going to incite rather than heal any anger, but how this depicted the violence which hate creates, it was hands-down a memorably horrifying experience. Who can forget the head-smashing scene? It's been 10 years and I still cringe.</p><hr><p><b>Ex-skinhead</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>SonderKommando, who was it that curb stomped someone? Who committed rape in a prison shower. I think you missed the point. We are all the same monster, regardless of color. Crime has more to do with society than race. Countries with much larger non-white populations aren't pulling down record numbers for violent crime. Why don't you figure out a way to actually help alleviate the crime rate rather than find a scapegoat? Kyle, I used to blame all of our problems on others, too. Those arguments just don't hold up for very long, unless you desperately want them to.</p><hr><p><b>shanice</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is an awesome movie about the reformation of a man who was almost brainwashed. I think the purpose of the movie was to show an error in a way of thinking, not to further encourage it. It was powerful and rough at times but easily in my top 5 favorite movies. So, to kyle, in reference to your comment about black people killing other people, did you know that the average serial killer is a white male between the ages of 24 and 38?</p><hr><p><b>ST</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. I like the ending too. The message is great and it raises a lot of issues of today. To respond to some of the comments about the white man losing or the minorities taking over I would like to say that the fact that you think that one races loses and another one wins is in itself racist. However not every statement about race and the differences between them should be seen as racist. I think that illegal immigration is indeed a huge problem in America. Many of these gangs are illegal immigrants banding together to protect themselves from other such gangs (MS-13 is a good example of this). I is also true that some of black culture promotes gangs and makes them seem more "heroic" then dangerous(for example rap). I listen to rap and have no desire to join a gang but not everyone is like that many who do live in hard situation are very impressionable. White culture especially in the south also promotes violence (kkk). I guess what I'm trying to say is that a few of these issues do need to be discussed rather then use the label that its racist to dismiss them because they are unpleasant.</p><hr><p><b>SB</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent Movie. But why does it have to turn into an us against them? When you look at someone and see a "white" person, what exactly does that mean? Does Norton act like say a Deniro just because he is "white"? Does Denzel act like Will Smith just because they are both "black"? I think not. The differences are staggering when you take every individual for what they are, a human being. Racism is just ignorance of this fact, if you see white or black or "minorities", then your social senses are lacking. You aren't able to penetrate deeper than the skin you see, you see but don't really perceive. You see the shades of color but don't understand the meaning of the painting. Think about this, is your mother just a white/black woman or is there more to her? How about yourself, are you not more than just a color? Do you not have a personality behind that skin? If so, then why categorize everybody else as such.</p><hr></td>
