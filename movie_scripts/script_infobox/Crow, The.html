And a soundtrack to die for. Film noir meets tragic avenger from beyond the grave? gotta love it.</p><hr><p><b>KevJackson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely Awsome Film. Brilliant Story, doesn't compromise. Excellent performance from Brandon Lee.
</p><hr><p><b>Xavier Black</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie has got to be the most coolest movie I've ever seen, I loved the setting and color of the film, and the soundtrack is the BOMB!. The acting from everyone was great, but my boy Brandon Lee did a butt kicking job Eric Draven.</p><hr><p><b>carly</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>My opinions on this film are mixed. It's a pretty amazing film but on the other hand I don't like how it is so unrealistic, although that's how the film is meant to be portrayed, as it is a fictional film. But that's my personal opinion on the film. It's just not usually the type of film I'd watch.</p><hr><p><b>vooren</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Hey, is this The Crow's script.. interesting. like different..</p><hr><p><b>Tiana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is one of those movies that you watch more than once. The characters worked well together. A lot of the scenes remain vivid within your imagination.</p><hr><p><b>Amy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely amazing. Playful with your imagination.</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Dreadful storyline, very lazy "they killed my girl" type story. Predictable events happening right on cue. Scene on the roof with the guitar one of the most pretentious I have ever seen. I guess I don't get the lure of the gothic scene but if this is it I'll not be slashing my wrists to the soundtrack which is really good. The song by The Cure is really good and gives the film the darkness it needs. Brandon Lee has good screen presence... had I mean. Visually a great film, storyline unoriginal. Unwatchable. Goth freaks will love it of course and after watching it can prowl the night taking acid hits and go hang out at McDonalds and lament about the cruel world.</p><hr><p><b>Bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good movie, I loved it!</p><hr><p><b>Indie Brit</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>GENIUS! Not quite as good as the comic but then very few of them are. This was the only Crow film, the other nevers happened! There was also no TV series either!</p><hr><p><b>Proctor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brandon Lee was killed during the making of this film. Some of the scenes are stunt doubles with his head pasted on. </p><hr><p><b>crystall</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was great it's a movie you can watch again and again!</p><hr><p><b>adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen The Crow so many times and it never gets boring. Brandon Lee is amazing in it. I've seen all the other crow films which are ok but not as good as the 1st one. Brandon Lee is a legend just like his father. There are 4 films of the crow which are called: the crow, the crow city of angels, the crow salvation and the crow wicked prayer.</p><hr><p><b>serdar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That's my life's movie.</p><hr><p><b>rohan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. It was so good, the best movie ever. Top Dollar is frigging amazing.</p><hr><p><b>spring</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>WOW! [almost] everyone's comments makes them sound like they're an 11 year old prep who just saw the movie. This movie was amazing, truly the greatest (or at least close) movie ever. I loved it, and it's so sad that Brandon died during the shooting, if they had made a 2nd one WITH him it would've been amazing. But they need to stop making so many sequels number 2-5(?) have all sucked incredibly, the only good one was numero uno!</p><hr><p><b>Aimee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love The Crow film, it is great. I love Brandon Lee, it was so sad to know that he actually died in the film. But other than that it is my best film with my best actor. Are. I. P. Brandon, everyone will miss you. But I won't because I have the film to remember you by.</p><hr><p><b>Tamara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have seen this movie at least 75 times. I can quote it line for line along with my friend Lynn who has seen it as many times to the demise of everyone in the room with us at the time. I have never seen a better movie to date. The idea that love can be twisted with such violence is an interesting one. If you liked this then you'll probably like true romance. Its a tarantino film. The hero and heroine aren't dead but its got a lot of the same ideas as The crow. The sequels are a travesty to the memory of Brandon. They have to stop or if they make another one they have to sit down and go back to the roots of the movies first idea. Possibly a female heroine? Something to think about. 

Cheers!</p><hr><p><b>aaron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What's that line he says to that girl? It doesn't always rain or something.</p><hr><p><b>chea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Everyone knows lee died in the making of this movie that is why most of you like it so much, so you can't go to the other sequels and piss and moan about how much lee woulda made it better but. They wouldn't have put him in those movies anyway. This movie was great though! Very dark and foggy, couldn't see much but still a good storyline. Even though it came from the comic book just makes it extra cool because now you can go read the movie you love. Just give these other movies some props considering they are all special in their own way.</p><hr><p><b>chea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>They did make a crow movie with a girl crow, its called "wings of the crow". It was a fan movie, not real good as I've heard, no influence to watch it. But if you want to. And I do think the sequels are good. As I've said. I have other comments on the crow the salvation and on here so if you want to hear what I have to say check em out because I'm not repeating myself.</p><hr><p><b>Devils Angel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film and all the others. This is the best film ever.</p><hr><p><b>Elle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome! Brandon Lee is gorgeous hehe.</p><hr><p><b>The Dude</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was Brandon Lee's greatest movie of all time, it will forever be one of the movie industry's best films. RIP Brandon.</p><hr><p><b>ETHAN J. BELCHER</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I got to meet brandon lee 3 days before he died. I was 4 at the time.</p><hr><p><b>QUEERMOE</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Greatest movie in the history of movies. First will always be the best of course. 2nd CROW was excellent too. I don't know why people say it sucks. It's a great movie along with the first. People gotta remember all the CROW movies are all different stories with different people. People shouldn't compare these movies on which is the best.</p><hr><p><b>natasha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Crow was a comic book series to start with and I think it bugs a lot of people because what was a book should stay a book but they forget the crow is a COMIC book series not a novel or a story or a book. Brandon Lee is amazing and did an awesome job with his character throughout the entire movie. A great success. I just wish he was still here to see how much he contributed to the world. The 2nd crow movie city of angels was amazing and I hate how people refuse to like it only because it was the second movie and not the first. People these days don't have an open mind to anything any more. To all the crow lovers - sleep with angels.</p><hr><p><b>juliowgmz</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I hate to say it, but this is a very badly-written screenplay. The finished product was excellent, if a little bit linear. But I honestly don't know how this piece of shit draft got produced. Thank god for rewrites, because this was just terrible. Like I said though - the finished product was great. Just goes to show you how far a reworking can take you.</p><hr><p><b>Jackez</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The visual product was excellent, the soundtrack to accompany it was just perfect. More often than not, incorrect music can destroy the importance of a scene, however this just flows together perfectly. The storyline was rather predictable however, that's just the way the proverbial cookie crumbles.
Just as a quick side note, and please feel free to call me on this, but Brandon Lee brought such life and depth to the character, whilst his was tragically cut short. It is a similar scenario to Heath Ledger and his performance in The Dark Knight, as The Joker.</p><hr><p><b>Craig Killarzoac</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is an amazing film but it's "ROBOCOP JR."  I dare anyone to watch ROBOCOP and The Crow back to back and not see the blatant major similarities.  I still love this film and I mean to give it 10/10.  The one star rating is to get peoples attention.</p><hr><p><b>graziella</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the most wonderful movie ever, this script is lovely. I love this thing about the script, even though the story is haunting and tragic, the sense of humor of few characters is very funny. Especially of eric draven. I love this movie. The crow rules forever. Brandon lee forever in our hearts, you're the best brandon rip sweet angel.</p><hr><p><b>leslie</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Entry eleven giving a rating of four out of ten. Jesse you rock. Don't and never will know you, but I am impressed. Having a personal library of some four thousand books and counting, and a movie library much the same, I can't believe you hit it in one. Personally, I think, Brandon and his daddy rock/rocked and it's very sad and all that, and yes the Crow is very Manga and it would be good to kick arse from the grave, however the whole thing had a music video feel about it not unlike the original Highlander. The little girl in the piece however, should go on to be the first female American President. This is from someone with Transylvanian/Magyar blood fermented down under in Australia. Jesse Keep sharp. Kindest and warmest.</p><hr></td>
