    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Eric</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent script. Maybe one degree of difference to the screen. Fair warning, if you plan on reading it all, you might want to visit the bathroom now.</p><hr><p><b>Sandra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For those that think that Rooney Mara isn't right for the role, according to the book, Lisabeth Salander is described as a pale, anorexic young woman who had hair as short as a fuse, and a pierced nose and eyebrows. She had a wasp tattoo about an inch long on her neck, a tattooed loop around the biceps of her left arm and another around her left ankle. On those occasions when she had been wearing a tank top, a dragon tattoo can be seen on her left shoulder blade.</p><hr><p><b>Diego</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>@Sandra I think that they meant her acting wasn't good at all or that they would have loved to see other actresses play the role. Who cares if she is pale or if she has black hair (long or short) or ultra thin, all that stuff can be changed, actors gain and lose weight for roles all the time and the tattoos can obviously be added on. You can go down to any city and find plenty of other women who are pale and thin with black hair. In the end it's how she portrays the role (character).</p><hr><p><b>jonathan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>David Fincher directed the hell out of this movie! Every aspect of this movie was spot on. As for the acting, it was phenomenal especially Rooney Mara. She completely disappeared into this role. She definitely deserve the Oscar nod. I am looking forward to what she does next.</p><hr><p><b>Gregory</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It must have been very difficult to convert nearly 500 pages of complex plot into this simplified screenplay. It's not the same as the book, but improves upon it in terms of spoken and visual drama. Well done.</p><hr><p><b>Ariana</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I watched it about thirty minutes into it and hated it.</p><hr><p><b>Diogo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent script. Excellent movie. Can't wait for the sequels.</p><hr><p><b>George</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies ever created. Rooney Mara is the one who made this film far more than perfect. I can't see any one playing or looking like this character other than her. Her acting is fascinating. She has an immense amount of talent. I've never been more captivated by any actress. She had me hanging on every word and facial expression, even the sound of her voice was transcendental and I'm not talking about the accent. Some people say her face don't look good in the film but I think she is drop dead gorgeous. Her looks penetrate while you get lost in her beautiful hypnotic eyes. Her body is so beyond sexy. It should be sin that God has blessed someone like her with the awesomeness she possesses. It's like it's almost not fair how she lives on higher level than your everyday basic girl. That was kind of a joke. But in a way not really. I think I might have a tiny crush on her but I'm sure a lot of guys do. That was a joke too. But not really. Actually I take that back, I do have a tiny crush. Any way I'm going to go now to GWTDT comments on the web to talk about the movie, you should go there to read my version on how I perceived this story, I think it will enlighten you very much, it will be worth your time, so go or I'll kill you. JK again. I wish Rooney all the success in the world.</p><hr><p><b>JC</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I stumbled on to this story as a sociology assignment, and was completely in awe of the author's (Stieg Larsson) powerful ability to captivate his audience and leave them holding their breath with each turn of the page. I immediately bought the other two books after having analyzed the first. I couldn't stop there… I decided to buy the Swedish versions of the trilogy next, and then I chose to buy and analyze the American version as well. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for a movie with all the components of a rollercoaster. There are gut-wrenching scenes, mystery, horror, a little mischief, a subtle romance with some steamy scenes, along with a variety of twists and turns that may leave you feeling a little dizzy. Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyvquist (of the Swedish version), as well as Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig, (of the American version) each make for an unusual but fascinating team in this action-packed thriller. The cast selected for both versions were meant for their roles. In either version, you will find they have gone above and beyond to entertain their audience. They play their roles quite convincingly. Who would have guessed that Rapace or Mara, both very petite and elegant, could pull off such dramatic roles as a shattered social introvert who is fierce yet vulnerable at the same time? Nyquvist and Daniel both show themselves to be a sharp-minded journalist out to expose the truth, and to win the trust and respect of not just the public, but also the very guarded social outcast they have come to sincerely care for. I think both actors and actresses deserve a round of applause, as they equally have portrayed their characters to the hilt.</p><hr><p><b>Tania</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A great script and a great movie, not quite as gritty as the earlier Swedish film, and Lisabeth a little too sexy (strange as it sounds) for my liking. Then again, I haven't read the books, so I'm just relying on comparing the films.</p><hr><p><b>Dean</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Excellent script and movie but I did like the Swedish version more, plus they have already made all 3 books.</p><hr><p><b>paul</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Swedish version was 100 times better than the usual Hollywood cookie cutter. Everything came out in the facial. This Hollywood version was just a way for Hollywood to get a piece of the action. People should watch movies from around the world before you comment on how great Hollywood propaganda is.</p><hr><p><b>Ken</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@George. You're weird, and not in a good way.</p><hr><p><b>Elizabeth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Perfect. Everything was absolutely perfect. Comparing to the Swedish version and the books - amazingly stunning.</p><hr><p><b>craig quinn</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Judging and nominating remakes is kind of silly don't we think.</p><hr><p><b>Sammy</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I have not seen the Swedish version to make a comparison, but for a major Hollywood effort, I thought this movie was fantastic. As a screenwriting student I am surprised at the simplicity of the script, because on film the director really makes it pop. I thought Rooney was fantastic, she was perfect for the role, but this is from someone who has not read the books nor as I said before, seen the Swedish films.</p><hr><p><b>kat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'd like to begin with a rebuttal towards paul, with whom's decision I must respectfully disagree. I'm currently a student studying film and while I understand the idea of Hollywood's "cookie cutter" tendencies; as seen in movies such as Let Me In, the remake of of the swedish Let the Right One In, Fincher's take on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is nowhere near being in this category. Fincher himself has had a great career as a director, and explicitly stated that this film was an interpretation of the novel, not a remake of the Swedish film. Having both scene every single one of the Swedish films and having read all the novels, I believe that Fincher's film is stronger in execution/interpretation, style, as well as acting. I was quite honestly stricken with the cinematography as well as the attention to detail. Having said that, there are aspects of both films which surpass each other, or very closely rival one another. Both interpretations choose to concentrate and emphasize different aspects, and I could go on for hours comparing both Mara's and Rapace's portrayal of the infamous Lisbeth. (Both were unique and astounding in my opinion). I really believe that just because a film is cinematically pleasing, it shouldn't be categorized as "Hollywood propaganda". Perhaps you should take care to study propaganda in film before tossing term around so freely. In the end, you have to consider that cinema began in the West, and other countries followed suit. While the importance of foreign film cannot be underestimated and great film theorists have risen all across the globe, America or "Hollywood" has always dominated in the film world.</p><hr><p><b>LisaF</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I have seen the American version at least 20 times, love the outgoing music- so sad, so poignant (written by Bryan Ferry). Have seen Swedish version at least 10 times and the complete trilogy at least 5 times. Rooney Mara's p0rteayal of Lizbeth is so compelling, so fascinating, particularly her voice and accent, which stays consistent, unlike "Blomquist". I am not sure why I am so compelled and fascinated by this film- I have been raped myself. Something there? With both films, I hated the opening graphics. Way too unsubtle. I haven't even seen "The Godfather" this many times.</p><hr><p><b>Jake Riding</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A better adaptation than the Swedish version, not to say the Swedish version is bad, but the American is truer to the book and has a more fitting cast.</p><hr></td>
