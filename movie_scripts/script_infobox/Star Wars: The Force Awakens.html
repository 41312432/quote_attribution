  <tr>
    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Joel Karlinsky</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>The Force Awakens is a total retread, boring, and has done as well as it has because of hype. Nothing new, interesting, or entertaining.</p><hr><p><b>Ethan T</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie. Just a tad too much of ANH, and the VFX seemed like a high-budgeted video game at times. But good movie overall.</p><hr><p><b>Luke</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A great movie do introduce Star Wars to a new generation of fans and to start a new trilogy. Bringing the essencial elements of the classic SW movies.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>JJ Abrams and his writing team have redeemed the Star Wars franchise from the unmitigated disaster that was the prequel trilogy. Great read, if not lacking a bit of polish and formality that big studio screenplays often have. Still, definitely worth a read. Very cool.</p><hr><p><b>Joaquín</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The movie was good, but the script had so much more potential, especially from the climax to the ending. I thought it did a great job setting up the sequels, but the plot was all too familiar.</p><hr><p><b>Force Awakens</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Solid Star Wars movie. Cool to see some of the characters we know and love as they have aged.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Awful movie! It is sad to see that Lawrence Kasdan- who co-wrote the best Star Wars movie (The Empire Strikes Back)- also scripted the worst one.</p><hr><p><b>Josh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anonymous out here looking like Trump with his speech patterns. Anyways, TFA sticks to the same formula that made its predecessors successful, and manages to stay entertaining even with a predictable plot. Characters are fun and the world of Star Wars is as fantastic as ever.</p><hr><p><b>CochiseJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A great way to introduce Star Wars to a new generation with familiarity, not trying to do things too differently like the prequels, yet different enough to keep pre-existing fans interested. Fun new characters, stunning visual and practical effects and a great nostalgia trip.</p><hr><p><b>Rabid Jawa</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This is a review of the script alone. While I found the movie itself to have some good points and to be okayish when I saw it in the cinema, I was still downright shocked by the poorly done and derivative story- and it's not as if I'm some dewy-eyed type who sees the other films in the series as flawless masterpieces. Subsequently I have been further shocked by the relentless attack-dog behaviour of a large part of this film's internet fanbase. (I thought "Hobbit" fans were the worst, but you guys.!) Thus, it gives me a certain satisfaction to be able to say, now that I've read it, that the script by itself is quite bad indeed and frequently an insult to the intelligence. Really surprised at Kasdan. *cue flood of 10-star rated posts accusing me of being Hitler or some such*.</p><hr><p><b>Kayoko Ann Patterson</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>If the future of star wars follows the example set by this, just rehashing elements from older (and better) films to get some emotional rise from viewers an relying on abrams' tendency to rely on nostalgia and fast action rather than making a quality story, then I have no need to watch this series any further.</p><hr><p><b>Sans</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Recycled plot of A New Hope, with little originality. The script is fine in terms of dialogue, but the characters are seemingly shallow and the villain is lackluster.</p><hr><p><b>Vincent</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>So the guy that produced Lost, the guy that wrote The Empire Strikes back and the guy that wrote Toy Story 3 all managed to take their collective talents of great storytelling and make a pile of dung covered in glitter glue. At least the Prequels were entertaining in their cheese factor, but this flick? Boring and dumb. A waste of time, money and talent. I doubt they even attempted effort.</p><hr><p><b>Mason</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Star wars was ruined when disney bought Lucasfilm, but when Rogue one was released is was not that bad.</p><hr><p><b>Frans Collier</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The Force Awakens completely fails to capture the thematic core of Lucas's Star Wars with an impulsive heroine falling helplessly into the role of faultless savior, and a troubled and contemplative villain being tempted to the light. In JJ and Kasdan's universe hedonism is fine and being good is effortless, while Lucas painted a more helpful picture where your greatest struggle is within. The plot is fractured between the ostensive goal of retrieving the map to Luke being interrupted by a tired *destroy the big sphere* handled with none of the care and passion of either of the originals. The script is infected with bathos destroying the weight of many scenes (a feature of many previous Star Wars scenes but now increased beyond tolerance), and all the catharsis and joy of the resolution to Return of the Jedi is undone by the very premise, suggesting that fighting against evil is pointless. The original films were uplifting. The theme of the young rebels fighting for a better future (and achieving it until Disney came along) is contrasted here by the next generation of the family falling back into evil, the old heroes, past their time, struggling to hold on to what they thought they had secured. If it were presented as a tragedy, with some fault in their ethos presented, it could be passable; but The Force Awakens continues to present itself as the up-beat obtimistic adventure its brad suggests. It is a terribly incoherent script whose only tangible points are an affront to the work it pretends to continue.</p><hr><p><b>Anon</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Honestly, the ONLY thing I didn't like about this movie was the blatant sinking of the HanxLeia ship (for non-fangirls/boys who understand fandom slang, splitting those two up) and that one Kylo Ren bit at the end. The bridge one. You know what I'm talking about. Otherwise it's great! New gen SW fan, first SW film I saw in theaters, although the plot is similar to ANH it's different enough to be kept interesting. I loved it.</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The Force Awakens has its moments but wasn't polished enough to achieve it potential. The main goal of the First Order and the Resistance is to find Luke Skywalker. However, he doesn't appear until the very end of the screenplay. He literally appears in the last minute of the movie and even then he doesn't say anything. I was waiting the whole time for Luke Skywalker to appear. Then I was disappointed when he looked so bitter, depressed and mean. Another Death Star?! It's already been done in the franchise twice before. Once in A New Hope and again in Return of the Jedi. The Death Star in The Force Awakens is simply a bigger one but ultimately easier to destroy. The writers could have come up with something more original for the ending. Overall, The Force Awakens is entertaining enough to watch a few times. However, with additional rewrites, it could have been better than The Empire Strikes Back.</p><hr><p><b>Guyfieri</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>The force awakens was a complete and utter disappointment and is a disgrace too all star wars fans and disney did a terrible job in every aspect. (sadness).</p><hr></td>
