That's all i can comment.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
Badly written, derivative, cod biblical nonsense with only breathtaking special effects as its saving grace. 

Watching Keanu Reeves "act" is like judging a fastest-growing cabbage competition. He is so wooden he makes the Cuprinol woodstain guy sound like Laurence Olivier! 

As for the film, well, it plumbs new depths in the dumbing down of entertainment. But, to my astonishment, there were two worse films to come - Reloaded and Revolutions. 

When Laurence Fishburne delivers his speech in the first sequel, we are meant to be empassioned with the ferocity of his call-to-arms. We're meant to believe that humanity can rise and survive...I just giggled in a state of tickled disbelief.  

Henry V's rousing address upon the field of Agincourt, this aint. It recalls the "Today is our Independence Day" shite from the film of the same name. 

Anyway, must wrap this up because I'll be here all day. 

I can't actually believe that masses of people across the world are imbued with a religious fervour on the strength of this twaddle.     </p><hr><p><b>HKP</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film that I have nerver seen it before!!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>still the best movie ever made</p><hr><p><b>jedimaster193</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, but the script isn't very accurate. I guess it's not the final draft. That's cool to read, but I'm looking for a script that's more word-for-word with the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Bripster</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Quality film, shame about the sad fan boys its already gained. I liked the special effects, but the story leaves alot to be desired: "A nerdy internet geek/loser becomes an all-powerful hero!" i mean, come on, geeks please!! </p><hr><p><b>Rickynet</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the real matrix, the reload and revolution sucks</p><hr><p><b>someone</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>hey, I like jedimaster193's comment, because it's kinda interesting.  We all know the movie, but you gotta know that a good actor takes creative liberties.  judging by jedimaster193's sn, I can see they know starwars, so I'll use that movie.  In empire strikes back, leia says "I love you," and solo says I know.  It originally said I love you too, but Ford argued with the writers.  It happens.</p><hr><p><b>Ross</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Matrix is a classic masterpiece with cleverly crafted plots, symbolism and media messages.  It's the best sci-fi ever!</p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>All I'm going to say is that this is the only one of the three worth watching.</p><hr><p><b>handson fingi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think it's really exciting, it's a cut above the rest.</p><hr><p><b>Dillon Yang</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh, the directors are philosophers! I love them.</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I didn't like this one really. At first I did until I saw it once again. It kind of put me to sleep. I mean c'mon Keanu Reeves is a good actor but the movie was boring. The others were the same. It wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be!</p><hr><p><b>Charon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Terrific movie with a very deep storyline. All you who didn't like it obviously do not see the philosophical complexities inherent in this and the sequels. This is the first movie to accurately portray what I believe is a very likely future. Watch "The Second Renaissance" I and II to understand what is going on.</p><hr><p><b>Jim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think Limey likes to make trolling posts about big movies. I've seen his/her comments on a few forums and they all tend to slag off really popular films for no solid reason. Okay so maybe Keanu isn't Kenneth Branagh- but seriously, why are you comparing a Hollywood movie to a Shakespearian play?</p><hr><p><b>Ondedlo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I read some of that script and I'm glad that wasn't the final movie version. Some of it was as corny as hell and way OTT. The actual movie nailed it though. They got everything right in the end. Great stuff.</p><hr><p><b>Sean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brill. I have seen almost all of Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski's films and THE MATRIX is the best by far.</p><hr><p><b>KAYMATRIX</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best of all time!</p><hr><p><b>eydryan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I find that the script outdoes the actual movie but I guess it is the nature of all books to surpass any one man's immagination. Also my favourite movie, I fave related paraphernelia from all around europe with its name on it and such. Now saving up for the boxset. 

and if anybody wants to know the best matrix explanation ever mail me and i'll gladly discuss it (it's not mine and it so explains the whole thing. I fail to realise how I didn't see it.).</p><hr><p><b>Hesekiel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Truly brilliant! Nothing like that to say about the next two parts though.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Jim, I'm not comparing a Hollywood movie to a Shakespearean play. I am poking fun at the insipid speech delivered by Larry Fishburne in the second movie. Henry V's rousing address is the benchmark for any speechwriter/scriptwriter that would aim to be inspiring. Also, regarding my flagrant dislike of popular movies- you may be surprised to read favourable comments from me on popcorn movies such as Notting Hill and Raiders of the Lost Ark. You'll find I am in fact indiscriminate when it comes to movie genres- the only thing I am particular about is that they are good.</p><hr><p><b>Bridget</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I liked this film, it has an amazing theme and some strong ideas in it. I loved how they made a modern version of Plato's allegory of the cave. Limey, whoever you are. I think you should have really looked into themes used this film before you decided to use "biblical nonsense" in your review. I think this film is very intelligent. Can you write me a script? And I want to see your acting as well.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Script lacking in depth. The only saving grace of this film is the special effects, without them this movie would not have been as successful. The acting in this film is fairly good on the most of part. Hugo Weaving proving to be a vital part in the film and the other agents prove to make this film much more realistic. Disappointing acting on Keanu Reeves' part, he seems to rigid and wooden in this film.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Come on Bridget, look into the themes? What themes would those be- the ones lifted from Alice in Wonderland, Philip K Dick? Be a darling and enlighten me, won't you? Because the only themes I took from this film, I'd already taken from a dozen other places. In my original post, I conceded that the special effects were 'breathtaking', as was the choreography. But as themes worthy of the quasi-religious following they have acquired, the trilogy falls horribly, woefully, laughably short.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I just love all these trilogy movies that are out there. This is one of them. It was a pretty weird and confusing movie at first but it still is very intriguing.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. Limey might want to take a look at the great commentaries by philosophers cornell west and ken wilbur that come with the box set before dismissing the series. Also negative commentaries by three critics too.</p><hr><p><b>Meg</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I must say. Those of you suggesting that this movie had too much of a religious element are certainly lacking philosophical education. This movie isn't supporting anything to do with religion or supernatural, it is simply gesturing that we should be thinking outside the box, and the reason that most of you don't get it is because you are, like most people, not doing such. It is the theory of knowledge. What do we know and how do we know it? Lifelong question that no one will ever figure out. I like mouse's idea. How do we know what chicken tastes like. Really? It makes much more sense once you do much research on man itself and whether we really are what we think we are. We believe what we want to believe, and the matrix is a good example of what reality could be. There comes a certain point where one is not sure of anything and realizes that he knows nothing. I believe the matrix did a good job of expressing the question of life itself.</p><hr><p><b>James</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Limey, by your last post you have betrayed your agenda, which has nothing to do with films, and everything to do with you desperately wanting to appear different from the crowd. So the matrix riffs on alice in wonderland and greek mythology, but so what? There are very few films, novels or stories that don't reference other works of art. You think 'Raiders' is a piece of 100% originality? Come on, even you must know Spielberg and Lucas came up with the idea purely to compete with the bond franchise. Yeah the Matrix sequels are rubbish, but give credit where it's due and stop disagreeing with people for the sake of it. And by the way, you like Notting Hill? You must be either a teenage girl or Richard Curtis.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best screenplay ever written.  If you've ever tried to write a screenplay before, this is poetry of visuals.  The exposition scenes are flawless.  The structure and arc hit points to perfection.  let's not forget this is a film that summed up the 20th century and was one hell of a ride.</p><hr><p><b>tasman</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best films ever. Next generation cinema yet to come. Breathtaking all the way. Follow the rabbit? Where in the hell did that came from? Red or blue pill? Excellent dilemma. Plato's cave is one source but the main source is simulacra by Baudrillard. Exists in the movie also. Check it out</p><hr><p><b>bZ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My dear Limey, I cannot help but comment on this. There are a lot of things in this world that human beings cannot possibly fathom, and so whatever we cannot understand, we blame it as unreal to remain in control. Isn't that what happened to you? Now please, never on the critic side, but it is quite natural, that the religion which you believe in has failed to root itself in your constructs, despite being one of the best ever taught. Education, as you know,  is a way of thinking and so is belief, a way of perception. So at no point of time, it should not confine your level of thinking.  I agree arguments help you think and grow. But do think of The Matrix as a dream and try to find out what 'Kundalini Meditation' is...I am sure my dear friend that you will certainly understand the genius behind the work. Leave the action and the hollywood blaze, it is a true state of the art made for those who have lost track of what we really should have been looking for, although it went a bit offline in the sequel that followed. But please do not take it as 'Alice or 'Startrek'. The story narrated in The Matrix doesn't have anything to do with Neo or Morpheus or Zion. Behind the action packed thriller, a commercial necessity, it is the about the struggle of a human body to attain superconcsiousness. Every character, including the 'French man', stands for some strong emotions we have, which refrain our true self from the quest for destiny. Please forgive me for if have been quite direct. I did not mean to dishonor your thoughts, but please do check what is the true message behind the movie is. Forgive me, but for those interested, I suggest a book called 'The Rajayoga' by Swami Vivekananda. Read it and you will know what Neo really stands for. This is a request to all my friends above who have commented on this, especially Meg and the thoughtful Bridget.</p><hr><p><b>Orb</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Good film. Limey, your post was already addressed, but I'd like to add something. You write off a big part of the plot with the words 'cod biblical nonsense'. I'd like to offer here that, every good story is based on the biblical ones, and really to get the best possible story you must really mimic 'the biblical one' to the greatest degree possible. Matrix did a good job with this, and coupled with effects, it was a smash hit. I hope this plain language can help to add to your understanding. Or prove me wrong. I know you like or feel obliged to dismiss the bible as nonsense, but then you probably haven't even read it, and yet! Sky higher than this, is the feat of actually understanding it.</p><hr><p><b>smurfsonite</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie, Orb, I agree with you and how it made it better that it had a biblical story plot and that made it better. I get upset when people like my step brother will say it is nonsense because of how the movie portrayed the bible story like that. I believe it made it better because there are a lot of people out there that won't even try to glance at the bible, this movie can help some people get interested in what it all means or what it was trying to say. We all want to get the right message and this movie is a great way to trigger thoughts that can lead people and their choices for years to come. I want to thank IMSDB for having this site up and letting us use it.</p><hr><p><b>truthseekers</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>First I thought this is redicioulus than well what is if it is true than I reasearched on freemasons and there art and symbols than i remembered some of the biblical stories about the mashiach like neo or nebukadnezar or the gospel writing on the ship mark...

But after a while I though and still think it is a propaganda movie for free masons and illuminati just check out the architekt or the checker floor or also the pass to enlightment and so on basicly this movie is in my eyes now promoting freemasons and illuminatis on a very deep level of misteris and lies...

maybe i m wrong on  that but many times those who seem to be the good guys are actually with a closer look to it not that good as they seem to be...

think about it</p><hr><p><b>kidscreenplaywriter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very well written, acted, visual effects are amazing... Basically every aspect of this trilogy is perfect. I admit in the first Keanu was a bit stiff, but even you (Limey) have to admit it was an amazing premise and idea. I just have to give all 3 a two thumbs up and a 10 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>Niraj Pathak</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Matrix IV: The commander Morpheus, Neo and all the crew member of Zion are dead in the last fight against the machines, at the eleventh hour Neo become successful in destructing the chip and the program responsible for hatred and betrayal from the mother computer. Now the mother computer started managing each and everything which is mismanaged in the last. Can the Matrix team approach me.</p><hr><p><b>Jacob</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I liked it. It had a genuine flow, that kept me reading. The diction was good, and it made perfect sense. They didnt make it to complex when it comes to definition, even though what they were defining was so complex. I don't get it why people rate it so low because they hate the movie, and not based on the script! The script is good. I read a lot and a lot of screenplays. It may not be perfect, especiaally when it comes to 1 page, to one minute format. But it still was good. I enjoyed it. And I did very much enjoy the movie. It says so much about society, how we're living a dream. And are all slaves to the federal bank, and to a world which revolves around material items. But hey, you got to WAKE UP! Lots of similies and metaphors too.</p><hr><p><b>ChargerX</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Matrix is the best movie ever made! It is the ultimate movie of all time and can never be surpassed! The first five minutes are the most exciting part of any movie ever made and will never be exceeded. The technological leap from what came before it is incredible. I don't expect to see such a leap in a future movie in my lifetime, from where we are now and the standard that The Matrix has established for all movies to be made from this time forward. The Warchowski brothers are genius savants extreme.</p><hr><p><b>blessing simbarashe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My best sci-fi movie, everything in it works. The concept is fine, the story is wonderful. I have seen it over and over and I can stop seeing the similarities of the movie to the story of Jesus and Judas. The story opened my eyes for the very first time. It set me free in the words of Mr Smith. Loved the dialogue of Mr Smith and Morpheus "humans are a virus on the planet".</p><hr><p><b>ExcessGame</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE! Any movie which can make you question what reality really is; and make you wonder, if in fact, what you think is real is actually real; that alone has got to qualify that movie for greatness. Throw in the profoundly thought provoking dialogue, and the brilliant observations of agent Smith in regards to humanity's lack of humanity, and you have a classic that will stand the test of time for all time.. The special effects are what they are; and they are actually the least of this movie's appeal--great as they are. What makes The Matrix special is its attention to detail. Like deja vu, and cookies that should have no taste or smell IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE, but do have taste and smell IF YOU DON"T. Minutiae, that only a genius mind would conceive of.. This movie should get 12 stars. Two extra stars just for being conceived.</p><hr><p><b>Calvin Smith</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It has so much to let us see. Its psychological and philosophical concept is amazing. I love it.</p><hr></td>
