Think about it... If Hollywood passed the movie then you've got to admit, it was funny and strange. Still think what I said was stupid? O.K., lets say you made a movie, you think that it is the best movie in the world... only because you made it. People might think your movie has no point... just like Napoleon Dynamite. People loved it, they might have liked yours... maybe. Still think it was stupid?

I dont no how movie like this can be sooo funny, LOVED it!!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Drakis</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I concede the fact that that was one hilarious movie. Okay, it didn't really have a story, but who really expected much?  This is just one movie people will watch once, maybe twice before getting too board with it and throwing it out the window.  I'm not talking about the die hard fans here though.  (That said, I don't think I'll ever get over that one line last line... "I cought you a delisious bass".)

As for that script... Not good at all.  It lacks description of scenes, people and pretty much everything.  It is more a dialogue than anything else.  I'm not rating it very well for that reason.  You can't even get a general idea of the movie by reading that thing.  If the producer created the movie with it, kudos to him.  That's one heck of an accomplishment.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>worst movie in the history of the world</p><hr><p><b>Tim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this movie was so good not only have i seen it 4 times now i also learned the lines of Pedro and can really act like him too like outside my house and talk about my bike cause it has shocks and pegs</p><hr><p><b>flippin aemy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow!

What do you think!!!!!!!!  Bow to your sensei. Bow to your sensei!</p><hr><p><b>nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watch that movie all the time and i practiclly know every line.</p><hr><p><b>cdavis</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>You have to give it up for this independent film. It is now both a box-office big boy and a cult classic. Now, with that said, I'll get on to the review.

I would most definitely consider this film extremely overrated. Many people that I am associated with have quoted the lines so many times that I was bored of the movie before I even watched it. The script is nothing special, and the beginning scenes can be quite random. However, as the film gets into Napoleon's plutonic relationships, it becomes a... better film, I suppose. However, that doesn't erase the fact that it is really based on nothing. But, while many boast that "NAPOLEON DYNAMITE" has no sex, violence, or foul language (unless of course phrases like "fat lard" or "friggin' idiot" offend you), I would rather have those sinful attributes as long as I was kept entertained. 

Secondly, the acting: no thanks. The Uncle Reeko part was played wonderfully, as was the small, but glorious role of Grandma. However, John Heder, who plays the one and only Napoleon Dynamite, was not so impressive. The squinty-eyed, extremely-exaggerated, and pathetically-not-cool personality was perfect for the role, and would have been a great addition to the movie, if it had not been for the fact that Kip, Pedro, and half the rest of the cast acted the EXACT SAME WAY! I feel as if the director said "Wow, John, That's awesome. Everyone, act like John. And ACTION!"

Now, was it an impressive indie film? Moderately speaking. Was it well directed? If you liked the movie. Did it deserve the MTV Best Film of the Year Award? Over "THE INCREDIBLES" and "RAY", not a chance. </p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Napoleon Dynamite is my favorite movie in the whole world i have like three shirts vote for pedro, Just listen to your heart thats what i do, and your mom goes to collage.

There was absolutely no disgusting humor or foul language, no sexual content or anything, unless you count the "Bust Must" jokes.

However, I think some people really need to stop quoting it all the time.  It's okay to do it around your fellow fans, but it really annoys people.

Not only did it have no meaning, it had no script. Was it supposto be funny or make you feel sad about people who might actually be that dumb. AWFUL. The only redeeming feature of this film was the soundtrack. This was one of those movies where 1 person who everyone thought "was cool" went to see it so everyone else did. The croud of people who enjoyed this could best be described as lemmings. </p><hr><p><b>amy and lauren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>napoleon is FREAKIN AWESOME . . . . its like DANNNG .

So I watched it and I'll admit, it was funny in the beginning .. but the scenes were choppy, pointless, and immature.  As I watched every scene, I thought they were the type of scene where something ordinary happens and turns out to be majorly important in the plot line .. guess what?  There was no plot.  The ending caught me totally off guard because there was no ending, basically, and when it was over, I couldn't believe I'd just wasted a couple of hours of my life watching it.

Sure, it was idiotically funny, but there was absolutely nothing special about it.  It was stereotypical and immature in content; it was amateur and choppy in cinematography; and in general, the movie seemed to pass by so slowly (perhaps due to the absence of a plot?).

Yes, there were great catchphrases, but they got way overdone after about a week.  And .. Jon Heder?  Totally not hot.


By the way -- notice that all the people who "OmGzZ LuVvEd ThIs MoViE iT wUz SoO fUnNiE!!!!" have really horrible grammar in one way or another.  That alone should tell you about the maturity and/or age of the audience of Napoleon Dynamite that was actually pleased with it.


Don't watch this movie, please.  Spare yourself.</p><hr><p><b>CatMorris</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It has to be set somewhere around 96 because they have songs at the end by Backstreet Boys and Jameraqui. So, good guess on the time period. Plus, I can remember some of those fashions still being around in the 90s. And they're in a super small town in the middle of nowhere, so they're probably not too up to date on the attire of the red carpet.</p><hr><p><b>mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>what the flip was grandma duing at the dunes</p><hr><p><b>anonamous</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I have lost my high opinion of everyone  I know from seeing this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Catherine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tjis movie was insanly awesome ..................iTS INCREDIBLE I WOULD WATCH 600 TIMES OVER N OVER ITS DA BOMB</p><hr><p><b>Monique</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i  recommend to take this movie out for some sweet jumps.

Now that's funny. Oh, but you might actually have to know a few things about history and life in general to get the jokes. Plus, did you notice how Pedro's tots were perfectly stacked in a triangle when Napolean grabbed them? It was just wrong. Very wrong.(This movie is why drugs are a bad thing becasue the guy who wrote this was seriously, life- threateningly high when he wrote it.) I guess I have to give the movie one star, but if I could, it would be negative stars, which I could do because I have permission from Bill Gates and the government, but I won't so as not to make you all feel like littlle ants or something.

And problably (or maybe I should say unfortunately) they were right. On the one hand I found this movie anything but fascinating or interesting. On the other hand I must say this movie is a bit controversial: because it has no plot. This is why I give this movie two stars. But I still can't understand how a writer is able to write such a horrible script, and even more I can't understand the fact that a director actually sees potential in the script. And finally I must say that I am a bit concerned about the fact that people actually enjoyed this movie. If you still have the intention to watch this movie, follow my advise: "settle down in bed around midnight, and play the movie. The next thing you will remember, when you wake up, is pushing the play button." </p><hr><p><b>Gracin</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This movie was pretty bad.

Well, it’s this: flying solo, that is, living life the stereotypically American way, the life of individualism, ends in misery. The only way one grows as a human, or even becomes human, is through a thick community of support, responsibility, and love. 

There are three key lines that reveal the meaning of the movie—and none of them are the seventy-four others that everyone quotes.  The first is when Napoleon says, “Pedro, just listen to your heart. That’s what I do.”  But here’s the problem: Napoleon does whatever his heart tells him, yet he’s still incredibly miserable.  And the reason is this:  what does it matter to follow one’s own heart when one’s heart is small or, to use a favorite word of Napoleon’s, decroded? 

The second critical line is Pedro’s: “If you vote for me, all of your wildest dreams will come true.”  What the moviemakers seem to be saying through Pedro is this:  if this kid can become class President, then really anyone’s wildest dreams can come true.  But here’s the rub:  Pedro’s dreams cannot come true without the support of the community.   He, and through him, the filmmakers, explicitly call on the community to support him and, indirectly, to support one another.   

Lastly, a third important line is Kip’s: “Lafawnduh is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.  I’m a hundred percent positive she’s my soul mate.”  The point is obvious:  any real human lover for Kip is better for his soul—makes for a better soul mate—than the relationship he had with, well, his technology.   Kip’s virtual life was pathetic.  His new life is weird and unorthodox but, by comparison, it is literally a ride into the sunset. 

The triumphant ending is when Deb plays with Napoleon so that, figuratively speaking, he need not play with himself any longer. </p><hr><p><b>Jacob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo freakin idiotically funny!</p><hr><p><b>Jess</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>it was sooooooo stupid that it was actually funny!</p><hr><p><b>Peggy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My 3 sisters and especially my brother love the movie!

Napoleon Dynamite is a very stupid movie.  I'm okay with people thinking it's a good movie.  I'm okay with people saying it's a funny movie.  But I cannot allow people to say it is not stupid.  Saying Napoleon Dynamite isn't a stupid movie is like saying Spider-Man isn't a superhero movie.  It's not bad, but it is stupid.  6 out of 10, which for me means more good than bad, but below average.</p><hr><p><b>Dolores</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That movie is flipin sweet.

I was pressured into seeing this movie from a friend of mine, and afterwards i stared at the tv screen with a blank expression on my face wanting to get back the 80 or some odd minutes of my life i had just wasted.

I will say this, however; to all of you haters out there who are implying that only stupid and immature people like this movie, and that its lack of film quality and or sophistication make it a bad movie. Do you do any research before watching a film? What the hell did you think this movie was going to be about. Did you expect a witty film like Woody Allen does? People don't love the film because its a great movie, they love the film because Napoleon Dynamite is an iconic character. The way he talks, the way he runs, even the way he dances makes us laugh uncontrollably. This is a film I will never grow tired of.</p><hr><p><b>TinaFreak</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is awesome!

Like the first time you watch it you're like 'cough cough very funny" and then its only afterwards that you realise just how funny it is. its the aftershock (i invented that myself :)  that makes this movie so good. And yes, it has some awesome quotes that can be applied to sooo many aspects and situations in life... but the question is: how many people would like napoleon dynamite if they weren't just liking it to be cool? Im not a diehard fan, i like the quotes and i love jon herder, but there are some people just over the top and you just KNOW that they're sooo faking it to fit in with the ' we really do like napoleon dynamite and we're so much cooler than you' crowd.
(Not suggesting that anyone here is a naploeon faker....*looks around suspiciously*)

Then over the next few weeks I kept hearing all these phrases again in my mind from the movie and they'd always make me smile and I started using them to respond to people in certain situations.

Its fanbase is composed of jocks, teeny-boppers, absent-minded modern-comedy fools and other categories that make me hang my head in shame. The flick is a demented beer-slam of events and attributes stolen from other comedic media (especially Beavis & Butthead).

(B) People hyped it up too much and made you expect it to be an Academcy Award-worthy film. It's just a funny movie. 
(C) This is just not your sense of humor. That's cool, but just because something isn't your taste doesn't make it stupid.

Hence the "low budget" feeling around it, plus when an indie film becomes a cult classic it's usually pretty unexpected so I doubt any of the directors/producers had had any of its success in mind when they set out, these things just happen. To claim that everyone who enjoys "true comedy" could not find this funny is definitely narrow-minded, I enjoy Monty Python (which seems to be the favorite here when comparing excellent comedy movies) and I also enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite, but what people have to realise is that there's different types of funny. This movie is not packed with jokes or action, but I think that everyone (or a large majority) fell in love with it because everyone knows at least one person they can relate Napoleon to. Yes, maybe it is a little over quoted, however I would rather listen to some Napoleon Dynamite quotes than to hear people try to sadly fake a british accent and kill the monty python quotes.</p><hr><p><b>nd_fan_4ever</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have seen Napoleon Dynamite at least 20 times AND I LOVE IT - I even memorized the script!

The first 2 attempts I literally fell asleep after the first 20 minutes. I figured I would force myself this time no matter what. So I watched this boring piece of crap and as the minutes went on I was praying it would get more interesting, but I was wrong. I had to fast forward through some of the dumb crap with no dialogue because it was so painstakingly slow and boring. I love sarcastic comedy, I love a movie that makes fun of itself but this was the lowest of the low. This stuff wasn't even funny! I said this stuff back in 3rd grade, I used Napoleon's exact lines. How can you find this to be smart humor 'You idiot!'' and ''Gosh'' - even I can do better than that. Oh yea and to Tia, even I love indie films, the more low budget the better, the weirder and unique the film I love. But how can you find this funny? I didn't laugh at one scene during the film. It's long, tedious and boring. The only scene remotely funny was the dance at the end. And I do agree with the other reviewers and comments as to what decade was this in? It didn't stick with a certain decade, the house looked 70s or 80s, the kids dressed in 70s and 80s but they had a retarded dad on a computer with chat rooms, that's 90s then they go and play backstreet boys at the end. COME ON, stick with a clear decade here. I can't understand all the hype about this movie. The whole population must have turned into mindless humorless drones with no sense of humor. My god shut up already.

I have watched the movie now over 100 times and have even memorized most of the dialog in the movie. I am still working on memorizing the entire dance routine that Napoleon did at the school assembly. Once I am able to do that, I may go around to different schools and perform the dance at basketball games, cheerleading competitions and at other school functions. I believe it would be very funny and would produce some serious "change" for me if you know what I am saying. I'll probably be charging somewhere around $200 for each performance. I may even try to contact some professional athletic teams about performing during half time of games, etc. I found a pair of the moon boots at an old "70's" type shop and they look very cool and great. I believe that the ones I got may be the exact pair that Napolean wore in the movie so they should be worth some good money!

Post-modernism in itself exists to break down typical conventions of the film genres, you only have to look at some of Tarantino's work to see this. I've seen some people express dislike for the lack of a discernable time period. That again is a post-modern genre, the anytime, anyplace feel. I've got to ask did any of the people that dislike Napoleon Dynamite like Pulp Fiction? It contained the exact same clash of culture, creating the anytime feel. Also as an indie film it is not about creating a high concept multi-million dollar blockbuster, it is about conveying the directors thoughts, feelings and ideas onto film. It just so happens that this indie film was unexpectedly thrust into the limelight, and therefore not the originally intended audience.

Then of course, we've watched it a few times more and at least once drunk and found it to be a really funny film.</p><hr><p><b>alicia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is flippen awesome. Woops I forgot to put in the crystals, hold on, ok I'm good. The point is it has no point, that's what the point is for you people that don't understand the movie. That's why they don't like the movie, because they don't get it!</p><hr><p><b>rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>People who don't like this movie are dead inside!</p><hr><p><b>O_o</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Was this movie supposed to be funny? As in haha funny. Because it wasn't. It was pathetic. I wish there was a rating for -111. I didn't last 5 minutes, I have a great sense of humor too. Were the writers on something when they wrote it?</p><hr><p><b>Teofisto</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think the reason people like this movie so much is because it's so out there from a conventional Hollywood movie layout. Usually you have a 6 reel movie script. The first two reels (40min) builds up info about characters & story, then you the next two that have the content & general issue building (the middle), and finally the last two reels you have the conflict and resolution. Since Hollywood & other big movie makers derive from this type of layout, our minds are used to expecting these steps. View Japanamation sometime, and you will see the difference in movie layouts from the Hollywood genre. Many people go to film festivals to see variety instead of the same old layout. They love to see the variety in movie creation, unique script layouts, and new camera ideas that indie films usually have to offer.  Napoleon Dynamite hit the bullseye, and everyone can't get enough it seems. I must admit that the first time I viewed this movie, I felt robbed of any sort of understanding as to what I just saw. I waited a few weeks and viewed it again, and this time was able to pick up the storyline pretty quickly. Introduce that with funny characters & stories most people can relate to in one way or another, and it's pretty damn funny. Yesterday I viewed the commentaries from the actors/writers/director & got a more interesting view into the creation and ideas to those creations that this movie provides - great stuff. At any rate, I compare this movie to a lot of weird movie layout classics such as Pulp Fiction, Crash, Four Rooms and Lost in Translation. This movie DID have a plot people, it was just laid out differently. Stop watching Hollywood movies so much and maybe it'll be easier to pick up. I think the only real visible person to show outrightly the end plot was Kip. As odd as the couple seemed, he got the girl even after he would brag over & over about always chatting with "online babes".  (who would have believed him??). I say go out and view this movie, but please view it more then once. Watch the commentaries too. The comedy is very unique, and you will either like it or hate it. I personally enjoy this movie, it's one I can watch over & over and still laugh at. I gave it 8 stars because at first, this movie is hard to get used to. Remember to throw away your idea of the conventional Hollywood movie layout, and ENJOY!</p><hr><p><b>O_o's Mom Goes to College</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>O_o, Is your mom supposed to be hot? Because she's not. How your father and her hooked up must have been some drunken party where he lost his eyesight. That's why your genetic disability of having not being able to see a great move comes from. You're obvious sense of humor needs to stay in church with the funeral services.  THIS MOVIE FLIPPING ROCKS! -111?  That's you're IQ, flippin idiot. I'm going to put my USA Parachute Pants on and come down and give you a roundhouse kick to the chops.</p><hr><p><b>napolean nerd</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Napoleon so much.</p><hr><p><b>Kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This MOVIE was good, the MOVIE was hilarious. This SCRIPT was clearly written by a highschooler sitting in front of the TV with their DVD remote handy. A script, a screenplay isn't simply a transcript or detailed camera angles, and this thing was just abhorrent. And what's more is that you all are rating this on how the movie was! This conglomeration of words and typographical errors is a mockery of a damned fine film.</p><hr><p><b>napoleons #1 fan!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie I love it. I really love Kip, also Napoleon. Uncle Rico cracks me up. The movie is so stupid it's funny as crap!</p><hr><p><b>uhhh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Napoleon is so cool! I love him.</p><hr><p><b>Caroline</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Napolean! I could watch it like a billion times.

We love Napoleon Dynamite, he is our baby. We love everything about this movie and the soundtrack. Napoleon is frickin awesome, gosh!</p><hr><p><b>p o'd</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>From many of my friends I heard this movie was really funny. However, this movie is the lowest of the low. Due to this movie I will never be able to watch a movie with the guy who played Napoleon. It is just that bad of a movie.</p><hr><p><b>Gaucho</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I'm 41 and my daugher is 11. We watched the movie twice this weekend. Smiles throughout the film. But after the DVD stopped we found ourselves in stitches replaying each and every scene. "Is she hut?". Writing and acting are magic, as are the cast. A truly wonderful film. Well done. "Bow to you Sensi! BOW TO YOUR SENSI!".</p><hr><p><b>Miss Thang</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I have the talking pen, photo album, trading cards, the quote book and a few shirts! It never gets old. You can't go in thinking you're going to be watching action and sex. It's just a sarcastic movie that is filled with loads of good quotes. I wish they had left in some of the deleted scenes though because they're GREAT (you've got to flip the dvd over to see them!). "Hello, would you like to look like this?", "But that's a girl", "Because for a liimited time only, glamour shots by deb are 75% off". And LaFawnda's name is great because my name is FAWN! That makes me a star.</p><hr><p><b>Cam</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Napoleon dynamite pwns n00bs!</p><hr><p><b>Mr Happy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You have got to have the worst sense of humor EVER not to like this movie. If you watched it once and didn't like it, watch it again with a friend. This movie becomes more funny the more you see it and actually pick up on things, especially if you lived through the 80's/early 90's as a teen.</p><hr><p><b>napolon luver</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was freakin awesome man the best movie ever.

Funkiest nerd boy ever. To all those who didn't appreciate the fantasticness of it: it was a joke about Hollywood movies fools, it didn't have a coherent plot because it was saying that most movies now-a-days don't you idiots. Also, funny jokes, did ya get them?</p><hr><p><b>Joe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Napoleon Dynamite rocks. 
"Gosh you freakin idiot" 

Oh yeah and Kevin I hope you read this comment becuase I don't give a crap what you think about this movie. 
P. S. The script dosen't matter when people grade movies they do it on the movie not the way the person wrote it!</p><hr><p><b>Marianna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Napoleon Dynamite is so cool ''gosh'.' I love the movie, I know every line.</p><hr><p><b>julissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>People who didn't like the movie is because it didnt have the F word or nudity, I really loved the movie cause is funny and show you the meaning of a FRIENDSHIP.</p><hr><p><b>kennedy lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie. Yo any of you who think movies have to have morals and have to have plots should be shot and shot again. Movies don't have to make sense to be cool. Oh and by the by I like your sleeves they're real big.</p><hr><p><b>craig</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was so funny man I loved it. It was so good, me and my friends just cracked up so bad like we were almost cryin. Dude it was awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved this. My favourite part is the dance. And for all those Napoleon Dynamite haters. Well. YOU GUYS ARE RETARDED. Anyway, if you hate the movie so much then why are you on here. Wait. Didn't Jon Heder who plays Napoleon also play Mike Teevee's dad in Charlie and the chocolate factory with Johnny Depp? COOL!</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Even though I haven't seen the whole movie yet I liked what I saw of it. The vote for pedro dance is the bomb! I'm gonna buy the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Matthew</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I was excited to see this movie because I was told it was hilarious, but to be nice-its not. I spent the entire movie waiting for the funny things to happen, they never did. I also spent the entire movie waiting for someone, ANYONE, to come along and kick his ass. I mean come on, what kind of a world do we live in were this kid isn't getting his ass beat every hour on the hour? And what kind of a douchebag wears winter boots during the summer? This alone should get him a swirly! Horrible movie, not funny at all, don't waste 2 hours of your life and if you see the guy that starred in the movie, kick him in the nuts.</p><hr><p><b>Jennifer xxony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's flippin sweet "but my lips hurt real bad!".</p><hr><p><b>amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Flipping sweet.</p><hr><p><b>super nerd</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Napoleon dynamite ROCKS !
how could anyone say any different. Jeez.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amber has serious issues. GOSH!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie was alright. Dumb but funny. Pointless, but not really a waste of time. The only three parts that made me laugh the most were the happy hands club performance and the skit and the whole 'your mom goes to college' bit.</p><hr><p><b>Kimbo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think napoleon dynamite is a movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to even get! The first time I watched it I didn't understand it, I was a bit like hmm not sure about this. Watching it again and people told me you don't laugh with him you laugh at him- I absolutely creased with laughter. I agree it gets what you did as a kid or what someone you know did or even what you wanted to do! There isn't an outright joke like you get in every other film- you have to just understand how to laugh at the kid and how much of a geek he is, the fact that he wanted to go home because his lips hurt. Just silly and I get it completely I love it. I think it's a film for intellectuals as it's actually quite hard to grasp but once you do oh my goodness you will be laughing for hours!</p><hr><p><b>La-Lafawnduh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Kip is so HOT! I mean Napoleon is pretty hot too, but Kip is just intensely steamin'! PHWOAR. This movie changed my life and because of this movie I changed my name to Lafawnduh, gravy-browned my skin, bought a big wig, had a special operation which made my teeth look a lot longer and sold everything I have to buy a big medallion for the next man I meet. I hope he brushes his toes over mine just like Kip does. I LOVE KIPPLING RONALD DYNAMITE!</p><hr></td>
