What CAN'T Johnny Depp do??</p><hr><p><b>Fiona</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is definatly one of the best movies ive ever seen. the realism in it is unbelievable, its funny in parts and johnny depp is an amazing actor. if you havent seen it your missing out. :) :) :)</p><hr><p><b>Dr. Gonzo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME!</p><hr><p><b>Daryl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely brilliant, i dont think there is anyone who wont enjoy this movie.I agree with emma - what cant Mr Depp do?</p><hr><p><b>phil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have to say that the most confusing part to anyone not under the influence of a mind altering substance, is what the movie is actually about. It's a brilliant piece of work that all need to look deeper into... if you like the movie, read the book! then read hunter- by E Jean Carroll.... it may change your mind forever!</p><hr><p><b>POTTER</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i love this movie so much, i wanna be just like hunter s. thompson when im older!!!....an acid head</p><hr><p><b>az</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anyone that thinks they have to be on drugs to get the movie obviously hasn't been able to see the brilliance and deep realities of the american dream. JD's acting is perfect. And Terry Gilliam has brilliantly captured the "true" life of Hunter S. Thompson. One of the clever things he has done is make the audience really think "Is this reality or the LSD I am seeing?" I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!</p><hr><p><b>Kat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Freaking hilarious even if you don't agree with the copious amounts of drugs taken! Lol. One of my all-time-favourites along with other Johnny 'Sexy' Depp movies.</p><hr><p><b>Ide</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks! I suggest you check it out doing some mexican magic mushrooms, that shit is hillarious! Don't ever follow what Depp does in the movie but mushrooms are cool.</p><hr><p><b>DUke</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Greatest movie ever made. If you haven't seen it, see it!</p><hr><p><b>TaZz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>GOOD SHIT! I don't suggest watching it after taking a trip though, I ended up in the cupboard because the bats even freaked me out. But Johnny explained and acted the whole unrealistic sense of the world on drugs so well I don't know where to start!</p><hr><p><b>Mandi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What a trip!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>As a former journalist with a hack’s penchant for booze, I always held a somewhat romantic view of Hunter S Thompson and his Gonzo exploits. 

But then I realised what a sick selfish git the man actually was – to blow your own head off with a shotgun at home, with half of your family in the room next door is really a quite appalling crime. 

His writing shows flashes of madcap wit that is occasionally entertaining, while his anecdotes defy belief with their outrageousness. 

And though I chuckled through the first five minutes of this psychedelic romp, I was left with little evidence of Hunter S. Thompson the journalist, as the film descended into the kind of tedious bore that only pot heads could possibly understand. 

In short, I was disappointed by HST. </p><hr><p><b>Limey is a Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Stick to the booze you're better at drinking than you are at writing. Read the book it's better than the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Dave</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>First off, spectaular movie. JD is amazing as well as Benicio Del Toro. Specular exploit of just how crazy drugs and 70's journalism could be. Secondly, Limey you're a moron. For Hunter to commit suicide is to show just how much he really loved life. From living a carefree, do what you want when you want how you want, and as much as you want life, to living in a wheelchair is a life altering thing. He shot himself out of hating life with restrictions. Long live Hunter S. Thompson.</p><hr><p><b>Dave</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>And he didn't use a shotgun either dipshit.</p><hr><p><b>U.T.P</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Cracker movie. One big acid trip through Las Vegas. Sounds mad!</p><hr><p><b>johnny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yea, great movie. We can't stop here, this is bat country, hahaha. That rocked.</p><hr><p><b>schoo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I hate Limey! Me likey Fear and Loathing. Splendid in every detail.</p><hr><p><b>Iron Moose</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Always love Hunter S Thompson's work, Depp and Del Toro personify the message Thompson was conveying to us. As your attorney I advise you to kill a six pack, smoke a fatty and witness first hand what great cinematography really is.</p><hr><p><b>Chachee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Johnny Depp is a pussy but this is a kick ass movie. I recommend it to anyone stoned, ripped and Twiztid.</p><hr><p><b>hunter s toshson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anyone who doesn't understand the genius of mr thompson is quite probally the beast Dr Johnston talks about. A man as tortured as Hunter was deserves the respect from all the internet critics that surround the abyss we call an opinion. Genius comes as nutty as a squirrel shit and the weird always denounce faith in anything bar numbers. Read the jokes not over and get a bottle of wild turkey hook it up to an iv and give up on weed. Guess who it's directed at. Watch the film, read the book, make a t shirt out of your mum's wedding dress and sit down and shut up.</p><hr><p><b>Mario</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Everything Terry Gilliam does is perfect. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas is no exception of that rule. Johnny Depp & Benicio Del Toro are brilliant! A must see movie.</p><hr><p><b>midnight</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Limey, if you were a journalist I feel for your readers. If you're judging Hunter because he committed suicide, that's messed up. Fear and Loathing is an incredible book and movie. The basis of book is a writer and his lawyer/best friend, going to Las Vegas in search of the american dream. Depp and Del Toro were amazing, they truly captured the relationship of "Duke" and "Gonzo". Hunter is an amazing writer and the "Wave Speech" is awesome. And truly I don't mean the watered down word awesome, I mean when you hear it you can just close your eyes and breath easier now that 'it' has finally found a way to be worded. Then ending scene, with Duke on the type writer is great too. You don't need to do drugs to enjoy this movie.</p><hr><p><b>dummy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the greatest if not THE greatest movie ever. I first watched it when I was nothing more than an ambitionless pot head and thought it was the greatest. Now that I'm off drugs and am a screen writer myself, I love it even more. Hunter's twisted way of speaking is enough to put me on the ground laughing and crying. How long before my attorney starts screaming and jabbering at this boy about giant bats and manta rays swooping down on the car. What would he think then? Indeed.</p><hr><p><b>White Rabbt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>God Damn Limey should be taken out and... No, that guy was a buzzkill. HST was a God among children scrambling to figure out if a line of this or a snort of that is too much or too little. Damn it man. Give me a bottle of Ether. I went into a drug store on the East Coast when I was 19 and asked the pharmacist if I could buy ether. I was all bug eyed and seeing trails and stuff but I felt compelled to disregard the lab coats and fluorescent tubes and ask anyway. Or at least it sounded as though I was asking him. Anyway, I was asked to put down the items I was carrying with me and to leave the store, and never come back. Obviously violated some socriactic oath or something. Anywho. Has any of you old timers seen William Murray (in later years referred to as Bill Murray) in his portrayal of HST in the movie "Where the Buffalo Roam"? Not a bad job. Typical Murray'esc style (just add a bottle, a wobble, and an opera holder). Anyway it was a pretty good B-rated movie by drunken studio heads that have never ingested a good wad of LSD25 or some wild strain of red mescaline and peyote's. Nope, the Whiskey, gin and Rye crowd can skwint their eyes through their 10 martini lunches and think they see a glimpse of what the elucide daytime trippers see and hear in the real world, but it would pop the 192 verricose veins in their bulbous blood ridden noses to even catch a nano-second blink of the controted hellish fear gripping at one's soul in the mist of a 3 day trip with no end in site. How can a drunkard, a drinker, a bozzer, a wino even kid themsleves (and try to kid us) into thinking that they can understand the depths of fear and insight in the mid of an enlightened genius during a heavy trip when you compare it to the de-evolution of the mind that Alcohol does is just so far from reality. A drunk could never understand a druggist. Period. And a drunk, will never understand what I just wrote either. Peace-Out!</p><hr><p><b>Tyler Durden</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Limey cannot begin to grasp the depravity and incomprehensible fear and confusion that comes to a mind full of blotter acid (which only takes an incredibly small amount, actually in the micrograms=. 001 grams to disconnect your thinking brain from your shell of a body that it is housed in. 
There has never been enough alcohol to put one in that state of twisted thinking (with the exception of a rare mixture of absynth and agave tecali tequila) to get you there. I reference the two specialized liquors because one is made with strychnine and the other a more powerful, more toxic poison so that it is not the alcohol that does the trick but the psychoactives that kick it into mind warp. No limey could not appreciate HST. Not in a million bottles of tanquery and tonics. Over the most fortunate of us to have walked in the shoes of the Dr Himself can truly sit back with a wide cheshire cat grin and realize that some of the best times in life have been the most fearful, demented, tormented, 3 day trips we were on when we were young. Yes, we can appreciate the tortured soul of HST, because in some ways there's a bit of it in every escapist. Sorry limey, you should stick to "The great white shark hunt" if you are looking to rate HST as a journalist.</p><hr><p><b>Hanna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is by far the best film I have ever watched, the realism of the way they are when on acid/ether is amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Taylore</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favourite movies. I love Johnny Depp in this. He is so versatile and talented. Benicio del Toro was great, too. This movie was so funny. It was hilarious to watch, and the actors captured what they were truly feeling (and seeing!). I loved when they were seeing the bats. Almost everything they said was so utterly and completely hilarious they I almost died laughing. Fantastic!</p><hr><p><b>Chenault</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>As appalled as I am about Limey's comment--like everyone else on here seems to be--there are pieces of it which I can deem understandable and more or less correct in some aspects. If anyone has read 'Gonzo: The Life of HST', then you might know what I mean. It is true, Hunter really wasn't the best of the journalists. Sure, he had a style and an insanity that no one else could touch, but his genius came in small bursts, and it was usually up to his editors or assistants to piece his brilliance together. If that wasn't enough, Hunter went on a LOT of assignments in which he never produced a story or work of any kind to speak of. Jann Wenner, a Rolling Stone exec, says he would give Hunter all these stories and all these opportunities, but by the late 70's and on, Hunter just couldn't produce anything. This is extremely evident even in Fear & Loathing, in which he writes absolutely nothing for the Mint 100 story he was out in Vegas for in the first place.
Anyway, I don't want to dampen the memory of Hunter. I'm NOT trying to bring him down, so don't get me wrong. Hell, I love him as much as the next person. In all honesty, he's someone I aspire to be like. But I just thought I'd set some truth up into this discussion board.
RIP, Doc.
</p><hr><p><b>Doctor Bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I never really "got" Hunter S Thompson until I got, as L Ron Bumquist has it, "cool" - and watched the film.  As Emma says - it's not a film to watch at 2am, much less 3am, unless you like upsetting your neighbours with hysterical laughter.  It was a nice touch to see Thomson himself (in the Matrix scene {"there I was - God, there I am"}), and it must have taken a lot of acting skill for Depp and Del Torro to carry the whole drugs experience off effectively - usually, when you're sober, you can't do it - when you're whacked, responsibilities are on hold, so being directed would be a bit difficult.  And it was good to see the American Dream put in its proper place - down the gurgler - although Horatio Alger had it mortally wounded anyway.</p><hr><p><b>Tony C</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>People of lesser worth try to graciously liken themselves to, either as an equal or maybe even more of another who has successfully achieved a level of greatness that they themselves will never attain in the smallest quantity, and try to qualify their own self and life in front of other to try and gain some type of temporary merit or valor for the lesser and inevitably boring ignorance of true life they themselves have stumbled through. So they comes to open public forums such as this and in a droll and virtually pompous fashion post such stupidity of "I did...." and "I was..." But the brilliance of it all is that most everyone will reject this type of person and their views. So to you all I thank you for your rejection of ignorance.

The true brilliance is Hunter Thompson, and his hypnotic journey through the abstract, which carried the realisms of life itself that many people have ignored or didn’t even know existed. His portrayals of existence itself are ones to be applauded and cherished forever. 

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is quite the brilliant tribute to Hunter and Oscar in a fashion that no other human being is worthy of attempting to detail. All the praise I could ever want to give to this work of literary art would fall short of the mark, and be a sparse attempt. So with that said all I can do is step back and fade into the shadows.

And then I read the book and realized Gilliam took out the soul of it all.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>So all you guys think it's okay to blow your brain out while your entire family is assembled in the room next door? That was the main thrust of my argument. I loved HST as a journo, don't care much for the film, and totally disapprove of the manner in which he decided to top himself. And that is all. If some of you are 'appalled', 'disgusted', 'sickened', whatever- you need to have a word with yourselves. Suicide may sometimes be a person's only way out but don't ever leave your family to mop up afterwards.</p><hr><p><b>marin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Okay so I am seventeen years old and I think this is one of the all time greatest films ever freakin made. The conversations are so off the wall it would be a hell of a great time. I applaud all of the actors especially Depp, he is too legit - they all showed why we still pay people to act, it brought reason back to films.</p><hr><p><b>JessTheMess</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@Limey This movie has nothing to do Hunter S. Thompson's suicide. This was a movie based on a book he wrote. Keep the two topics separate. Love the movie. I'm currently working on a parody video in his memory.</p><hr><p><b>G.O. Protoype</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"Fun" est movie ever. You need to loosen up Limey. Sanctimonious much? The movie celebrates the 20th not 21st century HST. In a hundred years anyone "affected" by his true-life, self-assisted, ballistic shuffle will either be worm food or urn ash so why dwell on it and what the f**k does it have to do with the movie. You need to stop, as are. Duke so eloquently put it, concerning yourself with "the desperate assumption that somebody… or at least some force-- is tending the light at the end of the tunnel." In the end, everyone chooses themselves. You'll figure that out soon enough. Who cares about right or wrong? Big whoop…. 'Least we got a book and a movie out of the deal. By the way Limey… I don't smoke pot or in fact have ever done drugs of any sort and still find the film coherent and enduringly appealing.</p><hr><p><b>Zarathustra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Why are none of the scripts right? Find the word "taco". Remember the "cheap tacos" scene? Where is it?</p><hr></td>
