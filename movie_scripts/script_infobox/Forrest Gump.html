I was wonderin', but, I was just readin' Forrest Gump script on my computer, my parents and I just saw Forrest Gump in the movie theater when I was about 11, I thought it was a great movie, it filmed in Alabama, I remember on the way back in the mid 90's, the movie was really great.

Thanks!

Alyssa

The Movie is fantastic. And I think it doesn't deserve rating 9.44. Give him the 10! This movie is maybe the best movie I've ever seen. It's funny actually, I've seen Tom Hanks in comedies, and dramas, but in a comedy/drama ... nope. The interesting thing is, that in sad moments, Tom Hanks says something stupid and funny. My favorite line is with 4 month rain in Vietnam. </p><hr><p><b>Kendra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was one of the greatest movies EVER made!! It's very strange how Forrest Gump had such a low IQ but we all could learn so much from this simpleton. Great movie, nothing less.
I love Bubba's VERY long line on all the interesting things you can do with shrimp. :)</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Purely fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>Gananatha Pathirana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good film.
</p><hr><p><b>Philippe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Real Hollywood chef d'oeuvre! Tom Hanks plays toppingly. I guess this movie will never be forgotten.</p><hr><p><b>aaron and katherine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>We love this film and talk about the funny things Forrest comes out with. He is a true legend! "Those look like comfortable shoes! You can tell a lot about a person by their shoes, where they bin' where they goin'. If I remember real hard I can remember ma' first pair o' shoes, they was my magic shoes".</p><hr><p><b>Jorge A.G.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie is great. It has almost everything that an ordinary american might want to see in a film: funny things, spirit, war explosions, heart and great actors too.</p><hr><p><b>konstantis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There are some things that you just can't change.</p><hr><p><b>Kendra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best I've ever seen, it really changed my way of thinking. Forest Gump sent me on a roller coaster of comedy, tragedy, action and romance. 50,000 thumbs up! </p><hr><p><b>Ida</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's my favourite movie. I could see it again and again and again, and perhaps not even stop there. I only wish I could give it a better rating. "Forrest Gump" made me see how simple it all can be, and how everybody focuses on things of great importance. If we all were more like Forrest Gump, Jenny (the whole wide world) wouldn't be having all this trouble. "And that's all I have to say about that".</p><hr><p><b>Becky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My all time favorite movie! This is a refreshing film that makes you see with a different perspective. We need more people like Forrest Gump in this world.</p><hr><p><b>Phil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"You got no leg Lt. Dan". Yea sweet movie, I like it and all my soccer team are using the sayings around practice now it's funny.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>WOW! This movie is incredible. I thought the book was great too. Tom Hanks did an incredible job as Forrest.</p><hr><p><b>Mary</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Forrest Gump is the best movie, I've ever seen! Can anybody tell me if the script is the original one or just a postscript?</p><hr><p><b>Leon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply adorable.</p><hr><p><b>Romesh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of the few examples in which you find that the movie is better than the book. Obviously, fantastic story line. Acctually with Tom Hanks you can have a guaranteed good screen play. The authenticity of the book and the movie is debatable but I personally think that the book was rather too far-fetched.</p><hr><p><b>Reg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the all time great movies. Still gets me choked up when he's talking to Jenny at the gravesite. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you yell at the screen, it makes you angry, it makes you PROUD. Not too many movies made now, or in the past, can give you THAT many emotions. One of a kind. I hope movies are made more like this. Masterpiece.</p><hr><p><b>V-tec</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Seemingly fictional, but how realistic in the key motives. This movie is a masterpiece! Stunningly beautiful and sentimental. One of those very few which didn't allow me to hold back tears. I loved all the parts with the distinctive southern atmosphere.</p><hr><p><b>kayleigh j</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely a great film. The best. I always end up crying at the end.</p><hr><p><b>fujun</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is very good!</p><hr><p><b>Sadic Freeman</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am in China, despite the different language it is absolutely a perfect movie. What I want to do now is to figure out whether there was a Forrest Gump in China's history of Ping Pang diplomacy. It is quite funny that Forrest can witness the friendship between China and the US.</p><hr><p><b>Abraham</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can you find a Hollywood movie that has a hero who is not an alien nor a predator, not a super or a spider man, not a terminator or gladiator, not a rocky nor a kick boxer but still a hero who occupies the mind and heart of every viewer at least at some point in the movie. He is Forrest Gump. One of the best movie of its own kind. Great movie, don't miss it.</p><hr><p><b>Jethro Wilbury</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is definitely one of the best movies ever made. The emotion never fades. Long live FORREST GUMP.</p><hr><p><b>~Alycia~</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>It was hilarious. Not the best but it was good!</p><hr><p><b>Fleur Dealcour's Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>My favorite comedy movie.</p><hr><p><b>Lena</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My sentimental favourite, for all time.</p><hr><p><b>Little Forrest</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie in the history of movie history and mankind.</p><hr><p><b>`'Chloe~*</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I cried SO much at this movie. It was awesome! It's now one of my favourites.</p><hr><p><b>Angel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's the best! All the time! You can watch a thousand times and still you can find something new. Run Forrest run - don't stop!</p><hr><p><b>x-lou-x</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Forrest Gump is the best and is my favourite movie! I love the characters and the location (Alabama where it is set). The story is so good but very sad. It makes me emotional. Tom Hanks is truly the best actor around. My fave character is Jenny played by Robin Wright. I could watch this film again and again.</p><hr><p><b>Puneet Kapur</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What a film! My all time favourite. Every time I see it I end up crying. Tom Hanks is extraordinarily great in the film. The film also has this positive feel of 'no matter what. I will' which makes it a winner all the way. KEEP WATCHIN'.</p><hr><p><b>erika</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love forest he's my friend.</p><hr><p><b>Callum</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I could watch this movie over and over. It is just so great I cry every time I watch it.</p><hr><p><b>Raymond</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie! I love this line: Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you, but I can run like the wind blows.</p><hr><p><b>peter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm a high school student from China. I like this movie very much. It moves me every time I watch it, even if I hear music of the movie somewhere. The speaking of the movie is very clear. I actually can understand most of the words in the movie without translation. So I watch it now and then when I get into trouble. It's a great inspiration! It's true: life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A true classic; for once I didn't care that it wasn't exactly like the book. The scenes with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are some of the most inspirational in film history.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. Never read the book but the movie was good enough for me. Is life really like a box of chocolates? The shrimp lines were funny: "shrimp soup, shrimp sandwich." A couple questions though how is it that Lt. Dan can go from young hookers/strippers to a nice lady who looks older than him. And Jenny seems to get older and younger throughout the movie with her young stripper look and old hippie look.</p><hr><p><b>Kayla</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie by far! It's so cute and so meaningful and it's amazing all the things he does. Even when there is a sad part he says something stupid and makes me laugh through the sad parts, like when Jenny is throwing rocks at her old house and she starts crying and Forrest says "Sometimes There Just Aren't Enough Rocks...". I love Forrest Gump and would watch it every day.</p><hr><p><b>Max Manfre</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Forrest Gump is definately a cult classic. The movie is funny and sad at the same time. Forrest is smart, but in a different way. This character is very loving, caring, and understanding. In reality, you'll never know what the future holds. In the words of Forrest Gump, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you're going to get." I totally agree with that saying. </p><hr><p><b>OCD_Freak</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Actually, it was Forrest's momma that said it. Forrest said "Momma always said that life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get". Forrest gets a lot of his sayings from his momma. "Momma always says stupid is as stupid does",  which I took to mean that being stupid is defined by doing stupid things.</p><hr><p><b>pvk</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie, most of the films will be forgotten once you come out of the theater or you switch off your television. But very few make you ponder even after leaving the theater. This movie tops that list too. Characterizations are exemplary.</p><hr><p><b>Ludovic</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I want to talk about Forrest Gump. I'm French, I'm 28 years old and for me Forrest Gump is the best movie of the world; I've never seen a so perfect movie. It's beautiful! All is beautiful! The character of Forrest Gump is so atypical and  everybody feels to be like him deeply in the heart. The beauty of this movie is the simplicity. The simplicity of a floating feather, the simplicity of Forrest Gump across the jungle of a hard and incredible live, the simplicity of the sentiments and the true. It's a life lesson!
I saw Forrest Gump at once, when I was nearly14 or 15 years old and I knew immediately it was the best movie I had never seen and today it still the same. Thank you very much to put The Forrest Gump's script on the web Because I'm trying now to write script myself and it's a pleasure for me to read this one.</p><hr><p><b>Damon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am a Chinese student. I immediately like the movie when I saw it. It is great. When I face difficult thing in my life I always think about Forrest Gump. My life just like a box of chocolate. I like the movie very much.</p><hr><p><b>Ansel Zhang</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>At the beginning, I just want to read the screenplay and train my English reading skill, however I think I love it now. It's the best screenplay I've ever read.</p><hr><p><b>Joey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over and over. A thousand times with out getting boared. When I was sad, I always see this move alone. I love Gump which gives me confidence to overcome difficult. My life just like a box of chocolate. I like the movie very much.</p><hr><p><b>Ono</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>As a teacher of English as a foreign language, so far I just found out the film in Bahasa Indonesia subtitles until I found this site which was a great help for me and my students. Now we know exactly what the actors and actresses said in the film. And it indeed helps us improve our English skills especially listening, reading, and speaking. Forrest Gump is one of my favourite. An inspiring movie. I wonder if you can provide more film scripts about school lives such as Facing Giants- one of my favourite films. Thanks so much for providing the scripts. It is really a good job.</p><hr></td>
