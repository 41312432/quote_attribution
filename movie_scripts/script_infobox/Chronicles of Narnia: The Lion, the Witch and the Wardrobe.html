    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Jason</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Good movie. I read the book long before this, seeing how true they stayed to the book and the visuals were everything I imagined.</p><hr><p><b>Joshua Scales</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The film was awesome! I absolutely enjoyed it. Just like "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", I saw this movie twice in the theaters. That's how good they both were. The acting in "Narnia" was off the chain! I am definitely going to get this movie when it comes out on Video/DVD.</p><hr><p><b></b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was sensational and I thought the acting was excellent. The animation was the best thing about the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Ian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was one of the greatest movies ever!</p><hr><p><b>Captain Jack Sparrow</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Superb movie, the acting was beautiful. The cast was magnificent. But the thing that bothered me (well I think it bothered everyone) was that I wasn’t there.</p><hr><p><b>Eliza B.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie, especially because it follows the book so well. I've already got my copy of the DVD reserved at the entertainment store, so I'll be sure to get it.</p><hr><p><b>Jill P</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow, the movie was amazing and was just like the book, except so much better! They didn't leave out important parts like some other movies that come from books. And I was quite surprised. Also terrific acting and I can't wait for the next movie. I wonder where there are auditions?</p><hr><p><b>Ambz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie, I loved the music too (I am going to get the soundtrack). It is the best movie I have seen, the acting was good.</p><hr><p><b>dovre</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was excellent.</p><hr><p><b>ndaru</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Good film.</p><hr><p><b>Juxtapose</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>"Good but not great" more or less sums up this movie; in terms of acting, direction and visual effects it fell about par. It's hard to talk about plot and development without talking about the book, but it was a solid and relatively faithful adaption.

Most of the visual effects were good but not showstopping with one exception: Aslan was the most solid and well done CG character since Gollum. He had a real weight and presence to him.</p><hr><p><b>hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie. I have been a big Chronicles of Narnia fan for years because my mom would read them to me before bed and I absolutely loved them! I was so excited when the movies came out and I must say that they did not disappoint me one bit.</p><hr><p><b>zoha</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It was damn cool. I mean I love it, that was crazy!</p><hr><p><b>Julius</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I like the Narnia-movie very much. It was so perfect and I love it! It was fun, dramatic and amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was AMAZING! Ann Peacock did a good job writing this script.</p><hr><p><b>Lexi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie and I am big on acting anyway. I just wanted to be there with them. My favourite character is Peter (William Moseley). It was fantastic, I can't wait for the next one.</p><hr><p><b>the_mp</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>It wasn't the most exciting movie I've ever seen. The war scenes weren't very imaginative and the effort to keep it at a PG rating detracted from the movie. The character transitions were also too quick, all of a sudden they're like, "oh, I have to change" and they do. People do not just change with a snap of the fingers. It has to be much more gradual for me to believe it.</p><hr><p><b>Jennie</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I thought this film was absolute rubbish. It bored me nearly to tears and I was so looking forward to it as well, the trailer looked really good! The children actors were terrible, the only good thing about it was that they actually did look related. A major disappointment.</p><hr><p><b>Rick</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The movie was so good that it gave me a good idea for my next movie. I liked the idea of walking through something and suddenly coming out in a completely different world.</p><hr><p><b>kavya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Superb and I liked it because it was quite adventurous.</p><hr><p><b>Fuzzy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved it! Especially when Peter copied tactics from the war in England, the bomb raid in the big battle. Lucy could have been a bit better in my opinion but it was excellent for music, sfx and the way it stayed true to the book.</p><hr><p><b>Rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good movie! Georgie Henley did a beautiful job of playing Lucy, Skandar Keynes was an amazing Edmund, Anna was wonderful as Susan and William Moseley was a brilliant Peter. I also liked how it stayed true to the books.</p><hr><p><b>Lisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing! I loved every scene, every minute. Narnia is a wonderful world with a lot of magic creatures, a wonderful movie. Georgie Henley was brilliant in the job of playing the young Lucy. Aslan was wonderful too.</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was a great movie. I love it and hopefully they have a #2 movie on the book.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
Christian propaganda! Mel Gibson has exposed a nice little niche for Christian film-makers to make a buck, hasn't he?</p><hr><p><b>vici</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie and most of the acting is really great, especially William Moseley as Peter. What bothered me most though was that it's such a wannabe blockbuster and they just don't do it right. e.g. The fight is good, yeah, but not as impressive as it should have been. I didn't really like Anna Popplewel as Susan and the girls should fight! But altogether I really love the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Beth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey guys! Anyone know if they're having auditions for Prince Caspain? I wanted to be in the first one but couldn't find any auditions.</p><hr><p><b>Denio</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The movie was good but there were scenes that they added that weren't even there. The director was all " Its exactly like the book!", NO it's not.</p><hr><p><b>Charles</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Not so good, I don't like it.</p><hr><p><b>Jamie Hodgkinson</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I do like Narnia but the acting was a bit wooden although Georgie Henley (Lucy) was quite good. Apart from all that I give it an 8.</p><hr><p><b>Marissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was good but I didn't like the part when Edmund got stabbed in the gut. My favorite character is Lucy because she's positive. Thanks Andrew Adamson!</p><hr><p><b>kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I've ever seen. It is fantastic and attractive. I come from China and I guarantee that every chinese person who sees the movie will enjoy it.</p><hr><p><b>maggie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved it, it had so much surprise in it.</p><hr><p><b>holli</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watched this movie again and again, it was so good. I'm a huge Narnia fan and look forward to the new movies now too. I rate this more than 100% because there is no dull moment in the movie. It was  the best movie I've ever seen and it is my favorite too!</p><hr><p><b>Chanu</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I would have loved to have been able to play Lucy because that particular film looks so much FUN! Excellent Film, watched it 7 times. I hope Prince Caspian is as good. Prince Caspian is being made right now! Georgie Henley (Lucy) is in this one as well.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie to pieces! I've always loved the book and the movie just blew me away. The actors were fabulous. I love all the music and all the characters and how well they all look! It made me cry at the stone table but that was what was so challenging. I loved Aslan, he was soo sweet. I've joined many rolepaying sites about Narnia now! :P. Overall absolutely FAB!</p><hr><p><b>jon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think the film was outstanding! I am disappointed by those who slate it because of its supposed christian links and how they feel the director didn't stay true to the book. He obviously has if these people bothered to read the book! It was great! Also the four child actors, (William, Georgie, Skandar and Anna) are phenomenol, they wouldn't have been cast if they were crap! They were amazing. Their emotional levels matched up to the characters at the right times in the right way. Well done you four! I'm 14 and I'm glad for the four actors to have acheived their dreams (even though they've stolen my dream!). Just joking! Good production. See it!</p><hr><p><b>luce</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great job.</p><hr><p><b>jack</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>It wasn't that good even with my kind of imagination.</p><hr><p><b>jon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>To be frankly honest the film is great and I don't think that (despite peoples beliefs) that the film went into production so the director could make money off christianity. I'm quite strong in my christian beliefs and think that it's not the christian thing to do to be angry over something as silly as a film, come on! Just look at the film as a good piece of film technology rather than an gesture of offense! It's an exciting fantasy story, also it's a good one. Just enjoy it!</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Loved every bit of it. The acting was excellent and all the creatures and animals looked real. I like how the Queen of Narnia dresses, it fits well with her character. I also think that Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Georgie Henley and Anna Popplewel did a great job. Well done you four.</p><hr><p><b>Tawnie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie! Partly because I like Skandar Keynes. Also because the acting in it was great.</p><hr><p><b>Cornelius</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I was a big fan of these books as a child so it is no surprise that I was very excited to sit down with the DVD tonight. What a let down. This movie is downright boring and, frankly, a waste of time. It is an editing nightmare and it seems to have "borrowed" far too much from Peter Jackson's version of "The Lord of the Rings". I will also admit that I, too, am a Christian and it seems to me that to many people (other Christians) are excusing the faults of this film because of the message it carries. I'm sorry, we must be able to separate the message from how the message is delivered. As a movie, "The Chronicles of Narnia" is just simply awful. I really think too many people are sticking up for this movie because of the Christian controversy; just like what happened with "The Passion". Both these films never needed to see the light of day and I don't feel that makes me any less of a Christian to say so.</p><hr><p><b>Scott</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Narnia. I love the books. I got the special edition of the dvd. I have a wall in my bedroom filled with Narnia posters. My sister said I am obsessed with it. I watch it every day on dvd.</p><hr><p><b>Audrey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>AWESOME movie! I completely loved it, I thought the CGI effects were amazing and it always kept you entertained. There was never a boring moment and I thought all of the actors, especially the kids were absolutely amazing in it.</p><hr><p><b>Samantha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Narnia is an excellent movie. I'm only 15 and I just thought the movie was incredible, partly because William Moseley is super beautiful. He's really a great actor, along with Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley and Anna Popplewell. I thought all of the actors in this movie did an absolutely amazing job. I loved how all of the creatures looked so amazingly real and how they really captured the magic and fantasy in it. I'm pretty sure that this movie will appeal not only to the younger generations, but the older generations as well because aside from the talking animals and mythical creatures there is a real message underneath it all. It says that really anything is possible in a child's head and that you can have so many good times just with your imagination. It also sends out the message that anyone can be brave and that family and love really do overcome any obstacle that might be in your life. It was completely and utterly amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Audrey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I adore this movie. William Moseley (who is gorgeous), Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley are such great actors. When I watched the commentary they made it seem so much fun to be working on this movie, I really wish I could have been in it. The CGi effects were amazing and the action in it was awesome. I really think William Moseley did and excellent job in the battle scene, which happens to be my all time favorite part. I also LOVE the music and I have the soundtrack, which is amazing! I watch the movie every day because you really just can't get bored with it. Great job to everybody who helped create this movie. Especially to all the amazing actors. Thank you.</p><hr><p><b>pussy kat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely loved this movie.

I read a coment somewhere above about the movie not being exactly like the book. If the movie was  exactly like the book it would have been far too long and far too boring, Lord of the Rings is hardly like the book at all and most movies aren't. I think all the actors were great and suited their roles really well. I think that whoever said that this film was borrowing too much off LOTR has something wrong because this was simply a far better movie and it all was very original.</p><hr><p><b>Darcy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so amazing, I thought it was the best movie I had ever seen. I didn't think it was going to be to good but it was brilliant! My favorite actor in that movie was William Moseley (Peter), he was excellent although the other ones were great too but he was just my top favorite! I REALLY hope that there will be another one with those same actresses and actors in it. I totally loved this movie!</p><hr><p><b>farah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film was excellent.

During the war scenes, on all the swords there was no blood. 3) The actors were horrible. They can't fake cry to save their lives. The only thing good about this was that the kids actually looked related to some point. That's where my 2 stars went in.</p><hr><p><b>Kat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was an incredible movie, everything was awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Elizebeth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie soo much i want to get a role in prince caspian but not gonna happen. I think that this hope girl that said the actors were horrible and that there was no fake blood is REALLY stupid. Why don't you try creating a movie, trying to make it seem like a whole different world with a battle scene and all you should put yourself in the actors point of veiw and try to fake cry when a camera is facing directly at you! You are the stupidest person I have ever met! Cornelius this movie is like a Christian movie, you obviously don't get the message it's sending. Like when Aslan dies for Edmund that is just like Jesus dying for us on the cross. It's not at all like the Lord of The Rings, that is truly an awful movie all of them. How can you say that this is a bad movie.</p><hr><p><b>Gaston</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie. Few months ago I would have said that Harry Potter and the Globey of fire would be. But when I see this movie, it was a pleasure. The director put all the moments of the book and also he added some that makes the history better. I can't wait for the second one and I also expect that second one is going to be like the first. What they said is true: "This movie, 5 years ago, could not be done" and I agree with him, it's totally perfect the special effects of the movie (they have some mistakes) but it's perfect. The actors who worked in them where spetacular, they really act good. And, Tilda Swaton (the White Witch) plays her character well, she was so cold and evil, but at the same time she was beautiful.</p><hr><p><b>hey!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was awesome and whoever dosen't like it obviously should be in a  mental hospital.

Taking notice it is a childrens/teenage movie it was pretty good and the actors are brilliant. It's one movie that can be watched several times and not get sick of it. Long live the King and Queen of Narnia!</p><hr><p><b>MorFetus</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie blows, this is the most annoying and awful movie. Lucy looks like she has downsyndrome and I cannot stand the child actors. The white witch looks like Uma Thurman on a bad day and the all the fight scenes are lame, I mean these kids learned to fight in two hours and get their weapons from Santa Claus! What the hell is this? I haven't seen such a lame movie since Kung Fu Hustle!</p><hr><p><b>May</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

But some parts of it were unreal, like some people here said, characters changed too quickly. How did the children change from war refugees to war heroes after receiving their "christmas presents"?</p><hr><p><b>Shelby</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>It was really good, I enjoyed the original more though.</p><hr><p><b>May</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I liked the movie, but in my opinion they could have done a better job on Aslan: his eyes don't look real, he is too small and his voice isn't deep enough. How could Mr Tumnus give Lucy the handkerchief, after Beaver had already given it back? Also, my Dad read the book to me with the perfect voice for Mr Beaver. Ever since, I have imagined him to have long teeth and therefore a strange "s". The warg sounded weird, sort of Canadian. But I loved Lucy & Ed and was disappointed at the Lucy from the old movies.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that the Chronicles of Narnia series is TERRIBLE but The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is REALLY GOOD!</p><hr><p><b>Abigail</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I think the movie was great, but Aslan talked too fast - he didn't look real. I liked him better in the old movie. I also think that the movie was more about them becoming a family than them going to Narnia.</p><hr><p><b>Sohil</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The movie is so good that I watched it in theaters more than once!</p><hr><p><b>Benjamin</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>All my friends were saying it was great, that I should see it and that it should have won a medal.

If I had to express myself about it in one word it would be very-good-and-you-should-see-it!</p><hr><p><b>fizz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The film was even better than I thought it would be!

William Mosely (who is very good looking) did an excellent job as Peter. I loved how after he saw Edmund being stabbed he starts killing everybody! Anna did AWESOME as Susan and I thought Georgie was really good as Lucy. If I had to change anything about this movie it would be ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I cried when Aslan was being sacrificed.</p><hr><p><b>Meghan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love how Georgie, Skander, Anna, and William perform.

He had so many scenes to do with Tilda Swinton which could have put any child actor off in their first film but he was the equal to her in acting.  Well done to all concerned with an amazing film.</p><hr><p><b>Parv</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was amazing. I have seen it 10 thousand times. All special effects in this movie were the most amazing but too many efforts have been done to make this movie for kids, I mean I saw no blood at all! And I must say Georgie was looking too cute in this movie, especially in the scene when Lucy insists Peter to play hide and seek. But the war in this movie was not like a real BIG war, I mean it was a bit lazy kind of a war but maybe according to PG ratings every single thing in this movie was perfect. Do see this movie and I am telling you do not dare to comment if you do not like this movie!</p><hr><p><b>J</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliance, but what did you expect?

I like how it's related to christianity because I'm a christian. I drove my parents crazy talking about Narnia. They almost wouldn't let me buy it! They chose the perfect people for the movie. Skander, Georgie, Anna and William are the best. I also think that William is really HOT!</p><hr><p><b>martin mcgowan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>These are the best CG effects ever except King Kong.

I have 2 favourite scenes in this movie. The first scene is when Edmund calls his horse "horsey", he recieves a bit of a surprise when the horse talks to him and says "The name is Phillp". It is very funny! The second one is when Peter hugs and cuddles and embraces Edmund and apolgises to him for being so horrible and not understanding what made him a bully towards his youngest sister, it's very touching and very moving. It was very upsetting that Edmund was completely misunderstood and also tied up after being unjustly physically beaten up by the stupid evil white witch's henchmen. It was very disappointing that he wasn't with his brother and sisters to recieve a gift from Father Christmas. I felt very pleased when he shouted "NO!" to the white witch not to turn the fox into stone, but then became shocked when the white witch slaps him. William Moseley and Skandar Keynes are cool and hilarious and totally outrageous! They are also the coolest and greatest of friends EVER. The movie is outstanding and perfect and very unmissable! I will never forget the night I saw it alone. I give it 10 out of 10. It's better than the Harry Potter movies!</p><hr><p><b>Erolas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the best movie I've ever seen, respect to the actors and Andrew Adamson.

Well, New Zealand! What else needs to be said there eh? Also, I was pleased to see that Weta Workshop delivered once again. The only sad thing is that we all have to wait until 2008 to see Prince Caspian.</p><hr><p><b>Krystal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this movie turned out really well. I believe that some things could have been done better, but what movie doesn't have a few glitches? The actors were awesome and I loved the special effects of the fowls in the battle scene. Really well done.</p><hr><p><b>Pieterjan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I am from Europe and I think I can say that this movie is a hit! The use of the green screen was sometimes visible, but this can't take a star away from my rating. When I saw the animals talk for the first time I had a strange feeling about it, but it is not something you see all day, not even in Europe! The movie is like magic! A movie for a cold snowy evening around Christmas time. But no movie can have a rating of 10 so I give it a 9.</p><hr><p><b>Nannie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Danny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE!

I'm a Harry Potter fan, and I thought NOTHING could beat it. I'm very happy to say I WAS WRONG! It was never boring at any point in the movie. The actors were all incredible. I wish I could go to Narnia, because the movie is EXACTLY as I pictured Narnia would look like. Long live Aslan!</p><hr><p><b>Insert_Name_Here</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I read the books repeatedly as a child, and I was very happy to hear that they were making a remake of the movie (the BBC version was a valiant effort, but one must admit that they simply lacked the technology to create the images needed in order for the movie to be convincing). The movie was as true to the book as a two hour long movie can be, the acting was good, the characters vivid. My one complaint might be that the animation was a bit artificial looking at times.
 This is a wonderful movie for kids, and it will keep adults entertained as well.

My favourite character would be peter always trying to be responsible just like me. My favourite part would be the big battle and where they were pronounced kings and queens of Narnia.</p><hr><p><b>Nicole</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Georgie Henley is my favourite actress.

And I just loved it!</p><hr><p><b>Katie Hobson</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Personally I think the film is better than the book, in the film it has more detail at the beginning when the place is getting bombed, whereas the book starts off with Lucy entering Narnia. Narnia isn't my favourite film, but at school we are acting it out and I play Susan, but acting it out is much better than watching it at the cinema or on a DVD.</p><hr><p><b>Heheha</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I thought Narnia was brilliant. It was very exciting and good. I thought all of the children, the beavers, the witch and Mr Tumnus were particularly good. I also liked that little fox the witch turned to stone (sniff sniff). We did this as a play in my Stage School and I was Lucy. It was the best fun I have ever had in my life being on that stage, so it must have been really fab for Georgie Henley. I envy her (sniff sniff SNIFF). And William Moseley is so good looking (sorry to Skandar, but you just ain't my type).</p><hr><p><b>Kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I thought Narnia was amazing! Everyone was fantastic at acting and each part of the film was wonderful. I could watch it loads of times and still love it. My favourite character was Susan. She was really caring. My favourite part of the film was when the battle started. The whole film was just truly magical and I very much enjoyed it!</p><hr><p><b>midred</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script was pretty sweet.

S lewis books in orderany time I am not stuck with homework it's really good to read l I thought it the movie was really fab for a 13 year old!</p><hr><p><b>It-Breaks-Things</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Looooove film, especially as it's one of my favorites in the series. There were a lot of changes, but I thought they were all decent, but I'm generally like that. I thought some of it was beautifully done, especially the additions of actual chirpy stuff .
AND Aslan still looked awesome when he was shaved, which, as everyone knows, was totally the important part.</p><hr><p><b>Paschalis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The ''Chronicles of Narnia'' are a real success. Excellent script, direction and all the cast and crew achieved the best result. An excellent story, that all must see! The author of the book has great fantasy to think of these! And here in Greece, this movie has been a real HIT.</p><hr><p><b>Taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I really liked this movie! It's was really good. I think the child actors did a really great job (I'm an actress and let me tell you, fake crying isn't nearly as easy as people make it look). But, the only problem I had was slow motion in the battle scenes. I don't know why, but slow-mo bothers me.</p><hr><p><b>Tassie-girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Such an amazing movie, beautifully done with a great cast.  I am now looking forward to PRINCE CASPIAN with great anticipation.</p><hr><p><b> &#10084; </b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It was absolutely amazing. I particularly liked how Georgie Henley was so great as Lucy at the age of just ten years! I'd say it is the best movie of the year 2005 yet, some people have rated it just four out of ten! I'd say no lower than 8.</p><hr></td>
