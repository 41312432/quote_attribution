A swashbuckling delight the likes of which even Errol Flynn would have been proud of. 

Depp's Keith Richards-inspired performance is, well, inspired. And he minces about like the very best of panto pirates.

But for me the true highlight is the performance from England's own Kiera Knightley (or Kiera twice nightly, as I like to call her) who is the very image of beauty and a great little sauce bottle to boot. Loved her in that corset, can't wait to eye up her jubblies again in the sequel. 

Would love her to hoist my flag, swab my missenmast, scrub my poop deck etc...Ok, have gone to far but you get the idea. </p><hr><p><b>Errol</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>
Wholeheartedly agreed, sir, she could swash my buckle any day. </p><hr><p><b>Lynna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>omg!!! dude, i LOVE this movie...and what the hell is up with the script? its like dead wrong....haha, i guess im that much of a nerd that i no the whole movie by hart. including the music. :/ im such a dork. i love it tho...orlando and johnny are like the to die for BABES of celebrity world and...if their shirtless sword fighting on a big screen... im suprised ive lived thru it so far. haha. aanyway IM DYING FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD!!!!!!  omg! july 7, 2006!!! CANT WAIT! </p><hr><p><b>josh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>omg wat a brill film cappin jack sparow rulez </p><hr><p><b>Missy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>HEY Dudes and Dudettes'
this movie is awesome!</p><hr><p><b>Missy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i love this movie!!!!  at first i thought it would be scary. i love will turner (Orlando Bloom) and captain jack sparrow (johnny depp)!</p><hr><p><b>pirate_luvr</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>the movie rocks!  getting the piano music was probably the best thing i've done.  i love it and so does everyone else.  i'm in 2 talent shows at school for it in dec and jan.  but i don't know who did the script...it totally bites and is not the same at all.  there is so many added lines that aren't in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Pirate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is full of swashbuckly piratey goodness which rules!

You work your stuff Johnny.</p><hr><p><b>Ashaley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The first time I saw this movie I thought wow good actors but after I saw it a million times I began to love Johnny Depp. Now I have his signature on a shirt made from the movie and me and Johnny are the best of friends. Maybe one day you will be as lucky as me and get to meet him to because in real life he is a hunk. HE IS SO VERY SEXY!! Even I want to marry him LOL.</p><hr><p><b>Kristina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG!  I LOVE this movie! Johnny Depp is SO sexy with black eyeshadow and eyeliner!

You know the writers did an excellent job and it was a wonderful cast and crew. I had never heard of Johnny Depp or knew I wanted to be a film director untill I saw this film. When I saw it I was like holy hell I totally was not expecting anything like that. The cinematography was terrific good work all round. Angela the casting manager for being able to get a hold of Johnny Depp he did a great performance so good work.</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is probably the greatest movie in the history of the world! I've seen it like 80 bagillion million times and I know every single word in the movie! 152 more days until Dead Man's Chest and I'm seeing it on opening day as an early B-day present! 6 days before my birthday I can't wait! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were very, VERY pretty in this movie!</p><hr><p><b>fey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>GREAT! It was so good.

Johnny Depp is so hot and perfect for the role of captain Jack Sparrow. And Orlando Bloom is so sexy and he looks so sexy when he sword fights. The rating that I'll put will be 10/10 but it's really a bajillion gazillion out of ten!  I LOVE IT!</p><hr><p><b>Kt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Caribbean ROCKS! I can't wait for sequel to come out on June the 6th and the 3rd in 2007 sometime in June! Johnny Depp ROCKS! I found him the best part of the movie. The part he plays, Jack sparrow, is so cool I love them both. Even though Johnny Depp is happily married, has two kids and Jack sparrow is a fictional character: CALL ME!</p><hr><p><b>Melody</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my gosh!

Developing such unforgettable characters as Jack Sparrow, played by the delicious and dilectable Johnny Depp and the suave yet simple Will Turner by Orlando Bloom, POTC will always remain a cult classic. Joining such groups as the Princess Bride, Pirates will thrill the young and old audiences for years to come.</p><hr><p><b>Captain Rikki Turner</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can you say sexy? 100 more days until POTC2.</p><hr><p><b>Theresa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my god Orlando is the hottest guy alive and he can sword fight.

My year are crazy for him.
The script is 'totally wrong' because it's a draft, when you write screenplays you write several drafts and then sell it to the producers who hand it over to the directors who edit the script for the crew and cast (lighting, actors/actresses, location crew, cameras etc) that's called director's cut which is probably the closest script you're going to read that's got the lines in the film (and even then when the ators/actresses are on the set they improvise round their lines so the screenplay won't be totally accurate). The script on here is probably the first draft or one of the first drafts as, I agree, it is totally different from the movie which is one of the best I've ever seen. The cast of Pirates of the Carribean are really talented and I can't wait for the sequel and the 3rd. It definitely deserved all the awards it got.</p><hr><p><b>lolo</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Caribbean is great man.</p><hr><p><b>Cindy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this is one of the best movie I had ever seen.

The SCRIPT comes first in the process of making a movie (shouldn't that be obvious?) and this one was just about perfect the way it was written. The story works MUCH BETTER than how it appeared on-screen (after the producers and studio writers got their hands on it). I for one, although I liked the movie in many ways, think the studio KILLED a FANTASTIC, TIGHT script. I don't know what they were thinking by changing the ending. UUUGHHHHH! Bad move on their part ARTISTICALLY SPEAKING, in my never-to-be-humble opinion. Script: 10.  Movie as filmed: 6.</p><hr><p><b>Azhima</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm so in love with Captain Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp!

One of the best films I ever watched in my life, I can't wait for the second! I thought it was a complete disgrace that Johnny Depp didn't win an oscar for his role in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Johnny Depp but I still think he deserved to win something. As for Keira Knightly, don't get me started on that trout pout of hers and those ridiculous pair of lips which she broadcasts across the whole flamin film! I mean come on girl! Us British have to stick together, americans can't always take the glory.</p><hr><p><b>Ezgi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very entertaining movie. Makes you forget that pirates in fact were the cruelest and stinkiest human beings who can commit murder in a blink of an eye. Jack Sparrow is maybe the sweetest pirate in entire Hollywood history, who is also the biggest part of the fun factor in this movie. Don't you think Johnny Depp looks better when he is in all make up?</p><hr><p><b>adriana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watched the movie 7 times today, it's my absolute favorite.

Johnny Depp was meant to play Captain Jack Sparrow. I can imagine no other in his place. Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightly have great chemistry on-screen. I'll be breathlessly awaiting the third installment. Possibly, hopefully, even a fourth? These are my favorite films by far! I would pay to see the second movie again, and many times after that. The third movie will be a joy to look forward to. I would have to say that sexiest pirate awards should go to Orlando & Johnny.</p><hr><p><b>TortugaWench</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh Goodness. I am so deeply in love with Johnny. He's the sexiest pirate I've ever seen. And Orlando's acting skills are improving. Little by little, but they're getting better. Has anyone else noticed he's taken on a few of Johnny's twitches and quirks? I find it interesting.</p><hr><p><b>Avery</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Orlando Bloom is the hottest guy alive! I felt so bad when he saw Eizabeth kissing Jack in the 2nd one. He spent the whole movie trying to save her, and this is the thanks he gets? Poor, poor Will. And what's up with Jack dying? I have never seen a main character die before. And how did Barbossa come back in the 2nd one, I thought he died in the 1st one, but still the movie rocked! But the 1st one still remains my all time favorite movie, but the 2nd holds a place in my heart as 2nd best movie I have eve seen. POTC rocks my world!</p><hr><p><b>Avery</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sorry, I've made too many comments, but I can't get enough of POTC. This movie kicks ass. Keira was so good. Most of us putting comments down are girls, so Keira doesn't get as much support as Johnny and Orlando because we obviously don't think she is hot. But she rocks! I wish my life was like Elizabeth's, she gets to wear pretty dresses, kiss orlando bloom, have a giant house, once in a while ride on a pirate ship with Johnny Depp and have a big aventure. It makes me hate my life. This movie rocks!</p><hr><p><b>Ella</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought that the sequel of this movie was absolutely fantastic!

Kierra, wow one of the best actresses ever!</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Caribbean 1 and 2 are my favorite movies ever! Humor and action combined perfectly. The cast is awesome too, so many amazing people to watch. I can't wait until the next one comes out! I heard it was coming out next May. Am I one of the only guys to write a comment for these movies? It seems to be nothing but comments from girls ha ha, I wonder why?</p><hr><p><b>Jade</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love pirates of the caribbean so much, I just saw number two the other day. I love both of them and I can't wait to see number 3. Johnny and Orlando are so HOT! And Keira is cool lol. I'm so obsessed I have so many posters and pictures of pirates of the caribbean everywhere!</p><hr><p><b>Deezmo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie! Yeah!</p><hr><p><b>BottleV</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script is only incorrect because it's not the shooting script. The shooting script is the final script (not all the drafts that come before [this one is obviously a draft]). The actors/actresses improvise a lot in their scenes as well which changes a lot of the script so you can see that the first draft can be very different from the eventual product. The writing is classic, as usual Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot turn out an amazing film. 10 stars!</p><hr><p><b>Amber</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The 2nd movie was so excellent. And Johnny Depp was even hotter than ever.  I'm his #1 fan and love him so much. I can't wait for the 3rd one to go into the cinemas. Good luck with your career Johnny and I hope you get to make more of these films.</p><hr><p><b>Arwen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was an excellent movie, although I was slightly disappointed: It was very much like the first one! Excellent lines from both Mr. Depp (heart!) and Mr. Bloom though!</p><hr><p><b>Christie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing, Johnny and Orlando are so fit apart from the fact that Johnny smokes. He's gorgeous though yummy.</p><hr><p><b>Brady</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love both the PoTC movies so far. Johnny Depp is so hot and suits the character of Jack so well. I love some of the things he says in dead man's chest, it's so funny. I only saw potc2 last thursday (20/7/06) and it was so good I want to see it again.</p><hr><p><b>Nair</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of its kind. Johnny is getting better and no one else, other than him would have been able to do "Jack Sparrow". Ooops, "Captain Jack Sparrow". Kudos for Mr Depp.</p><hr><p><b>Genevive</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were perfect pirates and perfect for this movie. Orlando Bloom cannot act at all, but other than that I have seen the movie so many times and I can never get tired of it. I also hate how crazed idiotic girls don't give Johnny Depp even the slightest dignity to say, "He's an amazing actor", but jump right into "OMG! He's so hot!". So I'm gonna say what I think he should be hearing. He's an amazing actor and it's astounding how much concentration he puts into his work. Geoffrey Rush is really funny and talented too.</p><hr><p><b>kayden</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't think they could've picked a better actor to play Captain Jack Sparrow.

Dead Man's Chest was an awesome movie.</p><hr><p><b>mrs Jenna Depp</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>They couldn't have found a better part for Keira, Johnny and Orly. The music is AWESOME! I find myself singing it throughout the day. I'm going to see the second one for the 2nd time in a week. I wouldn't be able to choose between the first and second one. I was so sad when Jjohnny "died", I really don't think he did though because he's too hot and he's too good an actor to die in a movie! What is with Barbossa coming back? I guess it will explain more in the 3rd one when they go to save Captain Jack Sparrow.</p><hr><p><b>Mrs. Sydney Depp</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am Johnny Christopher Depp's number one fan. He is the best actor in the whole wide world and I love him more than anyone else. Best movie in the whole world. I wish I could give it 100 stars.</p><hr><p><b>Miss Baird</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>NEARLY liked the second movie as much as the first one: both are totally excellent and I've only seen one person mention Jack Davenport. Yes, his character's not as humorous as Jack Sparrow and he's not as love struck as Will, but you HAVE to love Norrington in the second movie in my opinion.</p><hr><p><b>Erin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the first and second POTC movies. They are the best. But I never like the main character as much as the rest of the characters. And that goes for every movie or TV show. I don't know why, it's weird. But Keira Knightley is my favorite. I hate it when people never say anything about her because she is equally important in these films, and i hate it when people say great things about Johnny and Orlando but leave her out. Anyway, I have seen the 2nd POTC movie 4 times already, it's great!</p><hr><p><b>Jason Casa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw this movie when I was on vacation and it rocked there. They had speakers all around the theater so it kinda sounded 3D. The only downside was the baby crying, and the old people in front of us that were tall. I personally don't like when the theatres burst out laughing like at "why's the rum always gone, oh that's why" and when he shoots the bird. I like when the theatre is silent. We were one of the only ones (there was only us and another person) that stayed after the credits. It wasn't really worth it to stay 3 minutes after just to see that 5 second thing, but it's better than wondering "what could've I missed!". I was starving when we went back home because they don't allow popcorn. But I must say this was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>marijke</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>LOVE the movie!

I praise him :) Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was amazing, I watched it constantly. I've actually planned on seeing The Dead man's Chest since January. I jumped up and down as I watched the movie, it is OUTSTANDING! Just like Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp was clearly the best choice for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. Congratulations to the whole filming crew! You all deserve your fans' love!</p><hr><p><b>Lauren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was AMAZING! Johnny Depp is absolutely wonderful in the role of CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow ("Look." *shoots* "An undead monkey! Top that!"). The movie would be nothing if not for Jack. DMC is the best Disney sequel to date. GOD, I love Jack Sparrow! And (don't kill me for this!) I thought Norrington looked hot too, when he wasn't wearing the wig and covered in pig slop and schtuff. Do any of you know where I can find a copy of the script? I'm writing a story following POTC:DMC and a script would help ENORMOUSLY! Thanks!</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Completely AMAZING! Greatest movies ever! The first and the second one, both are the best. I can't wait to see the third one! Amazing job in all aspects. Brilliant is the person who's idea was to put Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, he plays the roll amazingly well, gives such a good personality to the character. And Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is absolutely perfect! I can't possibly think of a better actor to play that role! I've seen the first movie about 50 times and the second one 4 times. I have the script of the first one, and I really need the script of the second one please! There are not enough words to describe how great POTC movies are!</p><hr><p><b>Jason</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was the best I've seen in years! I can't wait to see the next one. The acting was amazing and the action was wonderful - especially the scene when they fought on the water wheel, it was funny. Jack sparrow is the one who made it so funny. I can't imagine somone else playing the part than Johnny Depp. He is a really good actor!</p><hr><p><b>sladija</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Johnny Depp is THE BEST. I think that he's lot better actor than Orlando Bloom. I can't wait for PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN 3, this is the best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Bex</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever. Jack Sparrow and Will Turner are gorgeous. I really wanna snog one of them so much. I am really confused about Barbossa being alive and I am really upset about Jack sorta dying. I can't wait for pirates of the caribbean 3, that will be ace.</p><hr><p><b>David Blaine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one the BEST movies in all history. One that succeeds in taking my breath away even now after the umpteenth time of watching it. I was a fan of Johnny Depp even before this movie and my fandom was solidified like the lava rocks. But I thought he overacted in P2:DMC. Nevertheless his performance in this movie is SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL that it's enough to forgive his performances for five more sequels! Yay J! J for Jack (sorry Captain Jack) and J for Johnny!</p><hr><p><b>Sammie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE pirates of the caribbean! I'm a freak now!

I don't like it when all these people put their names as Mrs whatever Depp because he's married and has 2 kids. It's nice that you all have your dreams and I know he's incredibly hot, but jeeze desperate much? Anyway I don't think I have gone a day this summer where I haven't watched the first POTC movie and I'm going to see the second one again! Johnny Depp has been in 46 movies and has produced 3. I haven't watched all of them but I'm planning on it. I think Johnny's best film is POTC 1&2 by far! He is my all time favorite actor ever and he is so hot! I also think Keira Knightly did an outstanding job along with Orlando Bloom. The special effects were awesome and did you know that Johnny was the one who said he wanted to act how he did in the movie? The director didn't want him to but he insisted. I give props to Captain Jack Sparrow for doing such a good job!</p><hr><p><b>0rli_l0v3r</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is the best movie in the world (so far).

I've seen the first movie 67 times, I've counted, the 2nd movie 7 times and have already seen the unofficial trailer for the 3rd movie. My only wish is that Orlando dumps Kate!</p><hr><p><b>Kirsty</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film ever! Johnny is an amazing actor and Orlando is so hot.

I'd like to see you make a movie. The actors were AMAZING. The special effects were AMAZING. But yes this movie definitely oscar worthy!</p><hr><p><b>______bloom</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are mainly the hottest actors. I heard that there were going to be 2 more, I changed my whole room to pirates and I was one of the 1st people to see the movie. It rocked my socks, it had 2 really sexy actors in it!</p><hr><p><b>POTC luver</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I was little when I first saw this, but I have rewatched it and it rocks. I can't say it is the best of all time. But it is a good flick. It has action definitely, things worthy of laughing about, romance. Not that much profanity. The only reason it is pg-13 is the violence and the fact the pirates are skeletons. But anywho, it is a good family film and a good film to watch with your buds!</p><hr><p><b>emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am mad about pirates of the carribean andmad about Jonny Depp, he is gorgeous.

It won't be nearly as good, but an awesome movie needs to be replayed by us weirdos! We don't have Johnny Depp -cries-, but one of my friends is like a mini Johnny Depp herself, so we're good.

Or to be more precise, Johnny is hawt (swoons). At any rate, the movie itself was amazing; the plot was wonderfully gripping and the characters were well-developed and funny. All in all, this was a great movie. Especially because of Johnny Depp's absolutely smashing approximately-seventeenth-century-British-accent. I love the undead aspect of the movie, because it feels like a salute to the RPG players out there. I count myself as one of them, or maybe half, but that's beside the point. This movie was really engaging. Actually, I'm obsessed with it right now, and have to watch it several times every week or go all spastic (not pretty). I write potc fanfiction. A wonderful fandom to be sure. The score is great! I love the music. I wish I had the cd, but I can't find it at the store.

The film is so funny as well which I love, I can't wait til the third one comes out (Pirates of the Caribbean - The Worlds End). OH and by the way Captain Jack Sparrow isn't dead. Otherwise the film would be completely crap without him in the third one! He's definitely coming back as he said he wanted to make more.

You have improved.</p><hr><p><b>Hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved both the first and second films (although I personally prefer the 1st one). Does anyone have any idea as to when the 3rd one comes out?</p><hr><p><b>jenny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE Pirates of the Caribbean, the 2nd one I think is better! The 3rd one comes out on the 25th May 2007 Hannah.</p><hr><p><b>bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>BlueFairy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVED DMC. It was AMAZING! I didn't think it was possible to get any better than the first film. And Johnny's just brilliant as Captain Jack - he's my favourite movie character of ALL TIME.</p><hr><p><b>the real Mrs. Bloom</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my favorite movies of all time! Very funny. Orlando Bloom is way hotter than Johnny Depp. So far I think this one is better than the second one but they were both still great. I will never get tired of watching this one and I can't wait to buy the DVD for #2!</p><hr><p><b>purrfect666</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It sounds great. I've read the book and all those girls who said Orlando Bloom is hot, he's mine so get lost.</p><hr><p><b>*Maggie*</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>These movies are so unique, suspenseful and wonderful. Orlando Bloom plays the best part. I won't watch it if he is cut.</p><hr><p><b>Elisabeth Swans Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Elisabeth is so hot, I love her. She gets even hotter in dead man's chest. I also enjoyed the movie.</p><hr><p><b>dale</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I truly think potc is incredible. My jaw was stuck in an open position throughout the whole movie. Although I did think it was strange that barbosa appeared at the end of the second one.</p><hr><p><b>Elynn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No one here even has a slightly interesting or educated comment to make. The movie was good, the second was okay, and the third should be worth seeing. People, we all know each character is"soooooo hot." Say something useful and stop blabbing.</p><hr><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply the best movie ever made. What else can I say!? It was amazing. Of course johnny depp made it what it was, fantastic. I am now totally obsessed. Now I want to be a pirate, and I've seen both movies a combined total of 51 times and still going because I will never ever get sick of it! I just love it. I memorized the script and everything. And of course captain jack sparrow is the hottest and most sexiest person alive!</p><hr><p><b>Jerry</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>As an action/adventure movie it was excellent. Although being based somewhat on a historical time period it fell short. Both Pirates of the Caribbean movies tend to proliferate false images of Pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy. But then again what do you expect from Disney.</p><hr><p><b>Amy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is by far the best film I have ever seen in my my life. Captain jack sparrow is so sexy but johnny depp can make anyone look sexy. I can not wait to see number 3. Everyone involved in the film are brilliant!</p><hr><p><b>Guynell</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Loved the ones so far can't wait for the next. Johnny Depp is truly a man with talent in whatever role he plays. But Captain jack Sparrow is his best role yet. Keep it up Johnny.</p><hr><p><b>Pirates fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was great! Everything was really awesome. I loved Johnny's performance, Keira was awesome, and Orlando was great like he always is. Also honourable mention to Jack Davenport (norrington) he's a really cool guy and great actor.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OK, is Johnny Depp the best or what? I mean, from the first time I say him I fell in love with him! I've watched the movie over 140 times and it's still interesting to me. I won't comment Keira because when I watched the second movie. Let's say that Elizabeth Swan is selfish and STUPID! And she does not deserve A man like Jack!</p><hr><p><b>kell</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Love this movie to death, I watch it every night almost. It's amazingly funny.</p><hr><p><b>Yzahbel</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>All I can say is that I totally love johnny depp! His role as capt. Jack sparrow is brilliant! Amazing! I don't think anyone could have done that role better. I wonder why he didn't win the award. He's so great, he's funny, and amazingly seductive even through all the gross things he does in the movie. I wonder how it feels to be Keira who gets to make out with him! I rate the second movie 9 because the ending left me hanging! I can't wait for the third one.</p><hr><p><b>Vicky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Caribbean 3 At Worlds End Comes out May 25th and has a monster that makes the Cracken look like a little pussy cat. Jack's father appears in it as Piracy is coming to an end with the new age and technology the east india trading company is controlling most of the sea. Brief plot outline! I watch P2 almost every day and I draw scenes from it, usually of Johnny Depp.</p><hr><p><b>Jack fanatic</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movies so far! They are so great! Jack is the best character and I totally love him! Will was really corny in the first movie but got a lot better in the second. I also liked Norrington a ton better than in the first. Elizabeth was as usual, beautiful and feisty and I loved the part when Jack gave Tia Dalma the "undead monkey". Barbossa came back in the end of Dead Man's Chest! How wierd! But cool too. Can hardly wait for the rest of the movies!</p><hr></td>
