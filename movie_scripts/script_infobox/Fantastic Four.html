There is a far worse travesty than anything do with the terrible script, acting and direction - the decision to cast such a divine lovely as Miss Alba as the invisible woman!!!

Surely that defeats the object of paying this ornamental beauty to squeeze into a spandex catsuit in the first place, doesn't it?



   </p><hr><p><b>CJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
Not so much the Fantastic Four then, as the Fantastic Phwoar! 

Funny how the name Alba makes me think of the word Melba, as in peaches...fuzzy little peaches! </p><hr><p><b>Danielle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow. I can't even describe how good this movie is. I think that the directors and producers picked a fine group of actors to make this movie. They were all great. People should really get this movie when it comes out on dvd!</p><hr><p><b>Patroklo</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>One more film of superheroes, with not very good actors and without any script....</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I thought this film was very mature and clean and intelligent-- not my favorite film ever, but, still, it wasn't at all terrible. Also, I'm a HUGE fan of Ioan Gruffudd's(a.k.a Mr. Incredible), and he was fantastic in KING ARTHUR.</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is an excellent movie. Actors were very well picked. Good action sequences.</p><hr><p><b>Buslady</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Mike Chiklis was the best pick for Ben, he was perfect and the fact that he was a fan already helped. Costume design, awesome. Sure he doesnt look exactly like the classic heavy browed Thing,  he's still one of many variations of the character. He was good. 

</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Worth the ticket price just to look at Alba. WHY WHY WHY! This movie is right up there with Batman and Robin!</p><hr><p><b>Bill</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The ending fight made me feel like I was in a boring chemistry class.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>It is a pretty good sci-fi movie.</p><hr><p><b>Shelby</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It's pretty good romance wise, but if you look at it from the science point of view this movie sucks! There are so many things wrong with it. I'm actually writing a report on it right now so I'm researching, which means I have to get back to writing!</p><hr><p><b>antariksh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Now this is the coolest comic book movie ever made. Better than X-Men 2. I loved it for its comedy, SFX and last 30 minutes.</p><hr><p><b>brittney</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I really love this movie, the special effects are great. I think Chris Evans, the guy who played Jonny the human torch is so HOT!</p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie was absolute trash! No offense to those who liked it but some of the actors were terrible. They weren't really about saving the world like most other superheroes. For instance, in Batman, it was about a boy tortured by the death of his parents to pursue a life as a superhero. And in X-men, the mutants were disowned and looked down upon by the general public. Get my gist? Also, I detested the Human Torch. His acting was terrible and I hated how every few seconds he would show off his powers. A good superhero is about NOT showing off their powers but saving others without any regard for themselves. I wouldn't recommend this movie, hands-down, and I agree with Limey!</p><hr><p><b>Savannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks. I got to meet the fire guy, he is so hot!</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Seriously.</p><hr><p><b>Tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The movie was not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Some of the actors need to work on their acting skill.</p><hr><p><b>Carly</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I got to admit. The movie wasn't that good. I found it really boring. The only reason I got it was because I heard that Laurie Holden was in it and they made her seem like one of the main characters. But she was only in it twice. I thought it was a waste of time and one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>leigh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well I loved this film, and now the 2nd one has been announced I can't wait. Oh and Chris Evans is so hot!</p><hr><p><b>Jake Toohey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I ever watched! I love every minute of it. Oh and Susan Storm is HOT HOT HOT!</p><hr><p><b>Matthew</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>As a fickle way to spend one's time, Fantastic Four was entertaining but with very few moments that last in the memory, just hazy moments of pretty CGI. That which does in fact reside most in my memory is the annoying little details of the movie that I had and have a personal disdain for. One such being, during a crash scene that seemed even more hectically thrown together and thought about than a real crash, that even the freaking fireman's dog reacted to what should have been impending doom, which ended up being, a highly forced heroes' first success as a super squad. There were other points in which the writing simply seemed catatonically childish and merely moronic. I am aware that it was not intended as any kind of psychological or philosophical discussion or insight, but there should be a way to please children and adults in a movie of such global importance (Sarcasm). Considering the fact that the movie was rated a PG-13 allowing for more adult themes, which were really little more than "Ha ha, she's naked." jokes, it could have had a wider basis of relevance. This is hoping too much, however, considering that even many current day R rated movies are just rip-offs of older movies with little true original thoughts or images used. Many of the themes of this movie were simply transplants from the comic book, and certain aspects from them were simply thrown into the mix because that’s how they were originally written and inked. For sheer entertainment value (the teens in the room seemed to be oooing and aaahing,) the movie is ecstatically, just okay. (After viewing it, many of those same teens stated that they didn't really like the movie that much). If looking for more of an intellectual trip, renting porn seems suggestible. The half, or possibly three fourths of Fantastic Four that I saw used computer-generated images often. The most prominent, use was during the crash scene on the bridge. The entire scene was impressive in the terms that they created in practicality every building in New York, the parts of the bridge not shot, and the waters beneath. The other scenes where it was utilized existed throughout the film. Each hero's superpower, except that of The Thing/Ben Grimm's, which was more of a rubber suit, need computer graphics to be created. Such as the stretched limps of Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, the flames of the Human Torch/Johnny Storm, and the invisible outline and verging on psychic powers of the Invisible Girl/Susan Storm. Another character in which it was utilized was Victor Von Doom/(The creative) Dr. Doom, for his mastery of electric fields. All of the images created seemed cartoony, but that’s okay since it's based on a comic book anyway. It is possible that I deserve tons of pieces of paper representing money now, preferably Monopoly money; I’ve had my eye on the Reading Railroad for sometime now.</p><hr><p><b>adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>This movie sucked balls compared to the comics! Sure most of the characterization was good but a lot of it was mediocre.</p><hr><p><b>Ashleyy</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks! I heard that they are gonna make a sequel to it. I'm really looking forward to that but sometimes people make  movies and they're awesom, but then they make a second part and it sucks ass, they just ruin it! Just like Cheaper By The Dozen, the first one was good but the second one WAS HORRIBLE! So yeah, if they make a second one I hope it's just as good as the first. I love Chris Evans!</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Everyone was talking about how great it was. It has okay acting in my opinion, but choosing "sexy, well known actors" wasn't smart and the only script were the parts from the comic books. And the whole time, it's just them planning to fight Doom, and then what? A five minute battle and just LEAVE him there? Oh, nice Thing though. Spiderman 2 is more like the original FF than this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Loux0x</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>This movie was okay. The special effects were clever and I liked Jessica Alba's part in it.</p><hr><p><b>Cyberpunk2077</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>After seeing Fantastic Four only one thing comes to mind, it wasn't a great movie but it was very entertaining. One aspect I must point out here is the actors had an excellent grasp of their characters. They were almost identical to their comic book counterparts. Especially Ben Grimm played brilliantly by Michael Chiklis of FX's "The Shield" fame. I had my doubts at first but after seeing the movie I really can't think of anyone else that would have played The Thing better. Ioan Gruffudd definitely lived up to his character's name in his portrayal of Mr. Fantastic AKA Reed Richards. Needless to say I also had my doubts about Chris Evans as Johnny Storm even though I enjoyed his performance in the movie Cellular. I must admit he surprised me with how well a job he did in F4. The luscious Jessica Alba brought an obvious if not over done sex appeal to the Susan Storm character and was indeed a pleasure to gauche at. However she would not be my first pick for that role. Finally we come to Dr. Victor Von Doom played by Julian McMahon known for his TV roles as Cole Turner on the WB's "Charmed" and Christian Troy on FX's "Nip/Tuck". I was not too excited by his portrayal but I think it was due to the character not having been written (for the film) very well. The overall story and retelling of the team's origin was done well enough too keep the flow of the movie consistent, however being a fan of the source material it is based on, I did find the story to be overly simplified, basically without explaining much or showing any real depth. Behind the scenes of this effects heavy action adventure, the direction under Tim Story left a lot to be desired. Story has not worked on this genre before (known only for directing comedies), left me feeling this film should have gone to more capable hands. The writers Michael France known for writing other Marvel films such as The Punisher and The Hulk, I think this is where Stan Lee would say "Nuff Said" and Mark Frost probably best known for his writing on the TV show "Twin Peaks". Let's just say once again this project should have gone to more capable hands. Be that as it may what really saved this film were the actors and the special/visual effects. Otherwise we would have had another Marvel movie disappointment for the pitch fork toting, torch carrying fans. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this Fantastic Four an undeniable 7. My recommendation: See it in the theaters but don't expect Citizen Kane.</p><hr><p><b>Dannie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have got to say it was one of the best films I have ever seen. The comedy was funny and Julian Mcmahon looks fit in this movie.</p><hr></td>
