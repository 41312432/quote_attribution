    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>tenika</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>one of my favourite movies....ryan/sebastion dying just killed me beautifully made and has everything drama,suspense,love,hate,comedy...everything....</p><hr><p><b>nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i didnt see this movie but i know only about it, that one of my favourite bands, placebo's song every you every me is in the movie...so i think it should be good:)isnt it?</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of best scripts I've ever seen.  I've watched the movie several times on DVD.  One time it was on ABC Family and for amusement I wanted to see what it would look like with the cuts.  The acting and the script held up despite the attempted mangling.</p><hr><p><b>Uni</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I hated it!!</p><hr><p><b>Indie Brit</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>it was eh.....uhm....difficult to get worked up about something so bland in places. It was ok but nothing great....frankly I have this on DVD just for that Sarah Michelle Gellar kiss....which isn't all that good....praise the lord is was £4.99!!</p><hr><p><b>krrisy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my fav. movies! Sarah is the best! I love also the grudge with sassy and buffy, SD1, 2, I know what you did last summer and other films with her.. havard man, Simply Irresistable. Great MOVIE-CRUEL INTENTIONS!!</p><hr><p><b>soph</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>great film. very quirky. sarah michelle gellar is great in this movie playing the two faced bitch kathryn and i thought selma blair was hilarious playing the innocent 'virgin' Cecile! great acting from both. id probably give it a 7/8 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>Historiador</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>As a movie it's not big deal.  I can't stand Sarah Michelle Gellar anyway, but Selma Blair is damn funny and Reese Witherspoon...well she has a nice clevage LOL.

What puzzles me is that I read the script and the final scenes are different in the movie.  Was a last minute change?</p><hr><p><b>someone</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This was a cool movie. Sebastian was hot!</p><hr><p><b>Cody Lee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great!</p><hr><p><b>Ivy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best script ever! I really love it.
</p><hr><p><b>bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Cool.</p><hr><p><b>brandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was the most awesome movie ever, Sebastian is so hot!</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie with the best plot that I've seen in some time. Sebastian was REALLY hot! I actually cried at the end.</p><hr><p><b>Sephy Lara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script is slightly different to the movie, but it's good. The movie itself is THE best movie ever. I love Sebastian, very HOT. Ryan Phillippe is like the best Sebastian out of the 3 movies! Doesn't anyone else think that?</p><hr><p><b>cristina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I know what most of you mean, I absolutely love this movie! I love the setting: Manhattan. I love it there, great place to visit. I also love Sebastian and Annette. Sebastian is cute and conniving. Irresitable! Then he falls in love with her! It's just a sweet, innocent thing  between them. I also love the way they talk and dress. It's great!</p><hr><p><b>Bes</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I just flat out love this movie, it's my all time favourite. I have the script, soundtrack, the dvd and video of it. It's a classic and even if I watch it 5 times a day I still will love it. It has a very good storyline with themes like deceit, passion, seduction, revenge and change. Words cant describe the movie, it's just so good and the plot is excellent. My compliments to the creators, producers and scriptwriters who made the best movie with the strongest heartfelt themes.</p><hr><p><b>B</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was the best, I love it. It's my new favorite movie. It's love and bitchy, I give it 10 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>kaitlynne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my days I loved it, Ryan Phillipe is so hot I swear to god I melted. Such a cool, clever film but his death at the end, I almost died! You all have to see it and anyone who hates it is just a bit gay.</p><hr><p><b>Shalavar</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Not a bad movie. A good remake of Valmont.</p><hr><p><b>louise</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved it! Best music scenes. The ending is powerful and leaves you with an impression.</p><hr><p><b>Buffy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow. This is my favourite film. I tell you it's definitely not one to watch with any adults around. Unless you can handle the embarassment, but trust me I thought I could, turns out I was wrong. This film is way too much for parents or any adult to watch. Under 21s only!</p><hr><p><b>Lynsey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this film, it was great. Ryan Phillipe and Reese Witherspoon are great together. Sarah Michelle Gellar is very good in it too. The end is great! I was left in tears. It's definitely one to look out for!</p><hr><p><b>Holly</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I usually prefer horror to chick flicks but this was great! Did anyone know that Reece Witherspoon and Ryan Philippe (after they met on Cruel Intentions) got married and had a baby?</p><hr><p><b>Marlee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ryan Phillippe is so hot! (Sebastian).</p><hr><p><b>Ted</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think it is the best movie ever made and it blew me away. Every actor is perfect and I can't think of a better movie!</p><hr><p><b>jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is cool and I really like it. The music is great and that kiss is really hot with Sarah and Selma. The 2nd and 3rd movies, they were not as good but who cares, the first one was amazing!</p><hr><p><b>T</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Seduce and destroy, damn, this is the most amazing movie ever made. Reese is so hot and Sarah is banging. That kiss is amazing, I love this movie and in my book it gets 10 stars.</p><hr><p><b>Kristin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much. It is a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>simon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever! Although it has 2 sequels which are rubbish, this movie proves that the 1st is always the best. The movie has 1 of the best movie endings ever. My favorite bit was when Catherine was saying her speech at the end and they all walk out while she's in the middle of it and she runs after them shouting and then my favorite song comes in; The Verve - Bittersweet Symphony. It's great, you can go get the dvd now. I got it for £4 at Asda. Go get it if you haven't already!</p><hr><p><b>DaStar</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I saw this movie ages ago when I was much younger and thought it was great. The premise of a boy who gets pleasure out of testing his skills is one that would resonate with most american teenage males. It's all about the thrill baby! But now that I studied film in higher education, I felt that this was a great mix of casting and writing that produced such a wonderful piece of art. And as always, the music makes it worth it.</p><hr><p><b>erika</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved it! Sarah Michelle Geller is really good in this role, it was made for her. I would have hired someone else to play "Annette" because Reese Withersppon wasn't so good for that. But Ryan Phillipe was very good for the role of "Sebastian" because I think he was very suspenseful! Cicel I was not so impressed with, but she was pretty good. I would have hired someone else for that role! Well I know no one will read this, but if you are I hope you respect my own opinion.</p><hr><p><b>judith</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever! Ryan Phillippe is just Wow!</p><hr><p><b>Illyria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script is awesome. Ryan is amazying and the rest of the cast even bettrer. I would have to say it's one of their best performances. There is not a part in the movie that didn't make me laugh, cry, or fall in love with the carachters even more. Great job, awesome directing.</p><hr><p><b>lou</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This film was good! Sarah Michelle Gellar was great in it. Her character was devilish but interesting. I haven't seen the ending yet so thanks for telling me guys!</p><hr><p><b>Alexx</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Sebastian and Annette improvised on some of their scenes, for instance the break-up scene. Some of the bits, such as the slap, weren't scripted but were put in by Reese Witherspoon. I love this film, it's so bitchy but I can't help admiring them in some sick way. Sarah Michelle Gellar should go brunette permanently, and Ryan Phillippe's ass is a sight to behold. I absolutely adore this movie! And am using it for one of my drama exam pieces.</p><hr><p><b>MTrajkoski</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The first time I watched the movie I was like five years old, so I was kind of like 'what the hells going on here'. But now that I'm older I get it. I've always thought it was a great movie. I like SMG in the movie because she played a part where she isn't a blond like she is in BtVS. And I think that Sebastian (Ryan) was totally HOT.</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely fantastic film. The acting was effortless from the main characters. Highly recommended to watch.</p><hr><p><b>jo</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>An Americanized modern take/pastiche 'movie' on an old Gothic classic novel, a great visual picture/ movie/film. Although teen movies sort of lost their luster after not another teen movie, also I feel that a reworking of the original text set in a different era would be great visual entertainment. Although the movie is both retro and nostalgic it falls into the scream/i know what you did last summer bracket and that type/genre of film/movie/picture does not seem to be as popular in the movie chart market today.</p><hr></td>
