How hilarious it was to see the floppy-haired sap freeze solid and plummet to the icy depths...I was overcome with joy to witness Leo's untimely demise.

On some level I do feel guilty about cheering an event which was an actual real-life tragedy. But such is the awfulness of this film that that's precisely what I did.  

"I'm the king of the world!" Give me a break!  

I must say I am almost reduced to tears by Celine 'Horseface' Dion's rousing soundtrack, but not because I'm enjoying it. 

My only regret is that she and James Cameron were not on board when it went down. 

And Di Caprio, scrawny little twirp that he is, must have it written into his contracts that his character has to get his hair all wet and 'sexy' in every movie. Though I must admit, it would have been hard to avoid in this one. 

So, movies where ocean liners plunge to the bottom of the ocean notwithstanding, keep your bloody barnet dry!

Apart from that and the liberties that Hollywood/America takes with historical facts, pesky little buggars that they are, I rather enjoyed it. 

Right, I'm off to see how Americans captured the Enigma machine during the war. 

P.S: Anyone looking forward to Hollywood's take on The Battle of Fallujah or the tsunami disaster in which an American scours some ravaged Asian coastline for his missing wife? Nothing like Hollywood to condense a tragedy affecting millions of natives into a tearjerker affecting a single foreigner.

Also, as a Brit, I wait with baited breath to see if The Few, rumoured to be starring Tom Cruise, ever materialises. The Few of course refers to the brave volunteers from the States who defended our little island and chased off the Luftwaffe because the RAF presumably wasn't up to it. 

I will watch it with interest. But by God, if they use Churchill's speech, a thank-you to the RAF -“Never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed to so many by so few,” to mean The Few Americans of the title, it'll be bloody murder! 

Apologies for the rant, 

bored in the office.
 </p><hr><p><b>Henry Vince</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>BEST FILM IN THE WORLD!!! Absolutelty fantastic, its my favourite film of all time. The actors are fabulous and i admire Leonardo DiCaprio for his ability to draw you into the film and really get into the characters thoughts and feelings, and being an actor i know how difficult it is to do that. The film makes me extremely emotional especially at the end when she walks up the stairs and everyone starts clapping. The music is fantastic and is perfect for setting the mood and getting your attention, im glued from the start! Family gets annoyed with me watching it over and over again! Its a good re-creation of what actually happened and the love story tops any other i have ever seen. Well done to everyone involved especially Leonardo and Kate for providing such a fantastic performance. </p><hr><p><b>Charlene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my absolute favourite movie! I love it so much, It is  the best love story ever told and i could watch it over and over again. This movie just makes me want to have half of the love that that Jack and Rose share. Titanic is an incredible film and i absolutly love it! It makes me fell all warm inside and i always want to watch it with a boyfriend or a guy, just so they can too, see what real love is. Leonardo and Kate do an excellent job and i would have loved to take her place any day. Most of all though, i want to find love like that, and if i cant Titanic is the movie too watvh for the best love you willl ever witness!</p><hr><p><b>Hewy</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Charlene, please! I have to protest.

You always want to watch it with a guy - how on earth do you manage to wrangle that? Are they castrated before they settle down to watch it with you and then whisper high pitched sweet nothings into your shell-like ear?

You like them to see what real love is? Uuuuurggghhhh....sorry, I just had to have a bit of a chundre into the big white telephone. 

And what sort of love would that be anyhow, the unlikely kind that exists between a floppy-haired, pre-pubescent and a huge-titted English 'rose' who looks ten years older?

No wonder the bloody ship went down with Kate Winslet's knockers on board which were, incidentally, the only highlight for me.</p><hr><p><b>Gabrielle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my god, I cried myself to sleep the first time I saw it. I used up around ten tissues. I'm sitting on the floor infront of TV surrounded by tissues, and my mom walks in. She must have thought I was going insane, but it's the best movie ever! Sad, sweet, Romantic, Funny. The Perfect movie!</p><hr><p><b>Amber</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>best movie i have ever seen it is cute, funny, thrilling, action, and the most romantic thing i have ever seen i cried for hours after i've seen this and i never get sick of it leonardo dicaprio is so hot!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Charlene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Omg titanic the very 1st time i saw Titanic i fell in love with the ship the charactors and the love story. i watch it everyday and it really shows the passion between Jack and Rose and it also the Tradgy of the ship sinking that bit i cried she was the largest moving splendid cruise liner eva built by man. </p><hr><p><b>gers no 1</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the 2nd  best film. and whoever says that leo is not braw in it must have like the worst taste in the world cos oh my god! if someone looked that hot walkin past me better watch out. a cant say a go as far as watching it everyday but a do watch it somtimes. the best film in the world has to be stand by me tho</p><hr><p><b>penny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i thought it was great</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>
It almost makes you glad the bloody ship sank!
</p><hr><p><b>sonny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>it almost made me cry.</p><hr><p><b>Cool dude</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the same as \" Walk To Remember\"  i like both of the movie if you know the movie im talking about!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>
I vomited when I saw this film! 

Not a closed mouth, try-to-hold-it-down, dribble on the chin vomit, mind you! Oh no. 

This was a ferocious, gut simmering projectile which was expelled with such force, that the telly actually shattered! And not a moment too soon, as they were just getting to that bit about flying!
 </p><hr><p><b>mr. fish</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>although i DID bring 2 dates to see this JOKE of a flick, there was always somethig that didn't sit right with me:  the number of times  "Jack" (Leonardo DiCaprio) says "Rose" (Kate Winslet) and VICE-VERSA!   so on a drunken hunch i googled the script and copied and pasted it in ms word.  Then, i did a text search for the word "Rose".  And YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE what i found!!!!!                 The word "Rose" appears....  are you ready for this?            666 TIMES!!!

that's right!  SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX TIMES!!   666   666

proof positive that Leonardo Dicaprio is the Anti-Christ!</p><hr><p><b>kijo</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>That was the worst movie that I have ever seen. The characters were one-deminsional, the music was terrible, everything was lame, the romance affair was dumb, Leonardo is a terrible actor and he did this as a  kid. He was just there to look pretty. It was long and torturing. I hate chick flicks espcecially this one even though I am a girl. I would take car chases, blow them up any day over this lame stupid gag movie.</p><hr><p><b>Evangeline</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br> I absolutely adore this movie, I've seen it tons of times and it still makes me cry. The scene's were beautiful, and so were the cosutumes. I also think all of the actors did a great job. Wonderful Movie. Ten Stars.</p><hr><p><b>Someone</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I just got the special edition on for Christmas and a movie poster and christmas ornements and I was sooooo happy!</p><hr><p><b>Milo</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
Personally, I'd like to see a remake of this one day, one in which Leo (not Jack, mind you, but Leo), falls overboard and is torn limb from limb by great white sharks. 

The sharks could then vomit the unfortunate Leo across the surface of the offending iceberg, the corrosive properties of which would dissolve the great hulk of floating ice, thus saving the ship, hurrah!

Not much of a story, I admit. But we'd still have Katie Winslet boobs to admire, the ship would be saved and the whole affair would be a hell of a lot easier to stomach. </p><hr><p><b>lucy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>ace ad i can't watch it without crying</p><hr><p><b>Kagome</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Like oh my god I did some research on this and this movie has everything the actual Titanic. Jim Slater, you are right, it is a shame that certain people weren't on it. But the biggest shame was that Jack died instead of you because, Oh I forget, you don't care if your mother died on it. Oh my bad I forget, your mother already died because of your ugly face.  Just imagine, if you were on the ship with your family and everyone died except you, how would you feel? But then again you don't have a family. for everyone who rated this movie 1/10 star, I think you should think again about what I said. You think is funny because you can't connect to the people who died on it, I can't either but because I never lost anything I really love, I can't imagine how the kids would feel, a baby of only 10 month lost its mother and brother and sister. What if that baby was you? And no one would take care of you.  Think about it. </p><hr><p><b>Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
For the love of God, Kagome, how utterly wrong can you be? 

It is precisely because the memory of those who perished onboard Titanic should be honoured, that utter tripe like this movie should not be allowed to endure. 

If you cannot appreciate that my comment was quite obviously tongue-in-cheek, then you must have had your sense of humour surgically removed. 

It is James Cameron who has dishonoured the memories of those who perished, by dramatising what was already inherently dramatic, with a nauseating saccharine soundtrack and a syrupy script. 

In my mind, it all cheapens the tragedy.

The fact that he relies on a love story as a plot device to fabricate such sickly drama in the context of such a tragedy, is also frivolous in the extreme. 

And, lest we forget, the false depiction of First Officer William Murdoch, who is shown as a coward and a murderer, accepting a bribe before shooting two passengers and committing suicide, when he was in fact a hero. 20th Century Fox apologised and James Cameron donated $8,340 to a memorial fund dedicated to Murdoch. 

When I say I’d like Celine Dion, Leonardo Di Caprio and James Cameron to have gone down with the ship, I bloody meant it. 

Aside from scientists with good reason to visit the wreck, ‘grave tourists’ like James Cameron and those seriously odd people who choose to get married in submersible vessels off the bow of the ship, are the ones who truly dishonour the victims. 

But I do them no dishonour whatsoever, not with my trifling little knock at this bloated blockbuster. 

P.S: Cut out all the "Like, oh my god," stuff will you? You aren't doing yourself any favours. </p><hr><p><b>maybe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I find it hilarious that there are no ratings on here between two and ten.  That seems to be because there are two perspectives on this: 1.)It's a cheesy, sleazy, tearjerker, and 2.) It's a transcendental love story that is only rivaled by Gone With the Wind.  I am with the number 2 people, but I suppose that's just me.  All the same, I have no intention of ever making a movie like this.</p><hr><p><b>Graham</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>The parts with no suspense put me to sleep.
There was reasonable acting, but the fact that they had to bring up one of the most controversial transport disasters, bringing back memories to those who have been on it and survived and for those who knew someone who didn't. The storyline was quite depressing actually. Pure crambert fromage from the deli section.</p><hr><p><b>harriet</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was very interesting .I personally think that it might be a bit sad for the people who were on the titanic when it sunk but a very good experience for others.</p><hr><p><b>Courtney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Titanic is honestly the best movie I have ever seen!!! The music was outstanding!!! I thank all of the people who put all of the hard work into this movie you did an excellent job!!! i give this 2 thumbs up. I like the way that you turned into a love story but it still had a lot to do about the ship. It was very sad and touching but great!!! </p><hr><p><b>jessemccartneyfan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG! I like totally loved this movie I thought harry potter was good but after seeing this harry potter is so..........fictional. Leonardo Dicaprio was so cute in this. I wish Jack didn't have to die. It was sort of weird how he didn't drown like most people but he froze. I always cry when I watch it. I LUV TITANIC!! IT'S THE BEST MOVIE ON EARTH!</p><hr><p><b>Missy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. It's awesome.</p><hr><p><b>LEOLOVER</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG! This movie has got to be one of the best....no it is the best movie I have ever seen!  I love the actors and actresses! Leo and Kate do an excellent job!  Not to mention Leo is a total hottie in this movie!  I am like obsessed with him now!  The love that they both share is so amazing.  I wish I was Rose so much!  This film won so many awards for the right reasons and generally if you haven't seen this movie you are crazy!  Go see it right now!  The romance and passion in this film makes me cry a river.  Because of Jack and Rose I truly believe that if love touches you one time it will last for a lifetime!  (MY FAV QUOTE FROM THE MOVIE)  GO SEE THIS MOVIE IT'S THE BEST EVER!</p><hr><p><b>Taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The titanic is so awesome! I looked up a lot about it, I have 2 books on it.</p><hr><p><b>Don'tNeedaKnow</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best! It's one of the most amazing movies ever. Leo looks hot in it and the actors/actresses did a really good job on the movie. They made it seem actually real and the ending when he froze, that was really sad but then again you can't have all the characters living to tell the story. I just don't get why she would throw that rubby in the water. It's a gift to keep and is for her memory, not to be wasted and thrown underwater to rust and be buried forrever untill someone just "happens" upon it. But no matter what it's still one of the best movies out there.</p><hr><p><b>Kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is my all time favourite movie ever. It has comedy, it has laughter, it has sadness, it has suspence. It has all the right things to make it the movie that it was. The actors in it where awesome, Leonardo Dicaprio, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane all did a fantastic job in making this true story stand out. The music in this movie is what makes it all worthwhile, the power behind when the music is brought in is breathtaking. The fact that Jack had died but Rose had told his story made the film all the more better because it showed that although he was gone she still loved him and like she said when he died she wouldn't let go. The love story is about a rich girl falling for a poor man and that is what makes it better, the fact money doesn't matter as long as you have love you are the richest people on the earth. I like the ending aswell, it is undecided weather Rose dies or not or if she is just dreaming about being with Jack again. No matter how many times a person sees this movie it still pulls on the heartstrings and makes you love it all over again.</p><hr><p><b>Crystal Schneider</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jim Stater you're such a jackass. That sceen was so sad. This movie is the best romance movie plus true movie you will ever see. So you just need to go away. This movie made me cry in the end when Jack dies that is so sad.</p><hr><p><b>iluvjessemccartney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG! I love this movie, mainly because Leo's in it. It's like one of my favorite movies, I always cry at the end. Why did he have to die? I thought Cal was ugly, in the script it said he was good looking. I didn't get that.</p><hr><p><b>Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Eee-aw ee-aw! Jim 'Jackass' Slater here; stumped, clamped, stupified and firmly put in my place by Crystal. Who am I to have an opinion anyway? 

P.S: Which scene was so sad - the one when Leo 'whiff of lavender' Di Caprio freezes and drowns. I laughed so hard I almost choked on my popcorn when that happened! A funnier scene was when little Leo, bowling towards the Pavilion end for once in his life, climbs on board Katie Winslet for a bit of 'how's yer father' in the car. Yeah, right, as if! That would be like feeding a Tic Tac to a whale. Tee hee!</p><hr><p><b>NVO</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of my favorites. For all the people who laughed when Jack died, you're all heartless bastards. I don't care if you don't like chick flicks
but this was a tragedy. And by the way this movie emphasized the tragedy of Titanic not dishonoured  it. It showed true love. Jack died for Rose all the other sappy stuff doesn't matter. Oh and Leo was hot!</p><hr><p><b>Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>NO, NVO, it's those who cry at Leo's death because he was so "hot" and not at the deaths of the others because they weren't who are heartless.  It's James Cameron who is heartless because he feels the urge to romanticize a tragedy by adding in a superficial love story! YOU are the ones who are heartless to cry at a fictional characters' death but not the REAL ones! I know that because I have insight - unlike you!</p><hr><p><b>The real Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>

It gives you insight into the real Titanic and sinking, whilst combining it with a beautiful love story that left me in  tears. I've seen it countless times and I ALWAYS cry without fail at the end. Leo is the hottest actor ever, especially in this. The love story is so genuinely beautiful that it makes me believe in true love.</p><hr><p><b>andre</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow this movie is wonderful.

Overall, amazing movie.</p><hr><p><b>tish</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I got a question to ask all the people who say this film is rubbish. What the hell are you watching? This film is bloody fantastic. I've only seen it 4 times but I'm hoping to get it on dvd soon. Oh yes and Leo is so sexy, especially in this film.</p><hr><p><b>travis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anyone who thinks this movie was as bad or almost as bad as most people think it is good really need their head checked. There's a reason this movie is the number one grossing movie of all time ($1,835,400,000) not adjusted for inflation - IT WAS THE BEST! The entire work took well over two years (starting from Cameron and his crew's first expediton to Titanic in August 1995). People who criticise the way they do have absolutely no idea how many people and how much blood sweat and tears went into this masterpiece. With maybe two or three historical inaccuracies (that can be proven) this movie truly is a classic and an incredibly moving piece of work. Some just do not understand and therefore never will appreciate it because they are so close-minded and narrow. But that doesn't and shouldn't matter to Cameron or others who worked on the film because they know how hard they worked and they know what an amazing job they did. The people who know what they are talking about (critics, the academy) also know that.</p><hr><p><b>bridie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think the film is brill 10/10 for definite.</p><hr><p><b>Rupert</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Nice insight Travis. So what you're basically saying is this: 1) That because it cost a lot of money to make, Titanic must be good. 2) That because a lot of hard work went into it, Titanic must be good. Never mind the dialogue, historical context or accuracy, cinematography, editing or score. As long as James Cameron and his poor long-suffering acolytes have worked their damned hardest then it must be a classic. If hard work and hefty investment is your only plumb line for measuring greatness then perhaps you should find work as a life coach: "Yes, I can" etc. P.S: You are a bloke, aren't you?</p><hr><p><b>Cownic</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is the best film I have ever seen.

Just breathtaking to see such a movie, I am even crying now.</p><hr><p><b>Stallance</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No-one on this thread seems to have established what makes Titanic a great film - it's not the love story for one, and it's also not Leo being able "to draw you into the film and really get into the characters thoughts and feelings." What a crock of sh*t. What makes the film awesome is the sheer number of quotes that it delivers - and I don't mean the stupid quotes that blubbering girls quote, e.g. "I'll never let go" or "You jump I jump". Those quotes should be banished to the bowels of the earth. I'm talking about almos every other line in the film, quoted by 'lesser characters'. I doubt many people really notice the subtle inflections of voice and facial expressions that most characters demonstrate. For example - "Is it a...?" "Diamond? Yes" or "She's made of iron sir, I assure you, she can - and she will. It is a mathematical certainty". Bottom line is, stop rating the film for false reasons.</p><hr><p><b>Kaitlyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Titanic is 100% the best movie I have ever seen. I love it! Actually I'm listening to the soundtrack right now. Leo and Kate did a phenomenal job as the characters and it makes me want to cry every time I watch it or listen to the soundtrack. James Horner did such a great job composing the music that it's unbelievable. I have seen this movie about 30 times at least in the last 8 months and my family and friends think I'm crazy for watching a 3 hour movie so much. Just thinking about the sinking and all the people who died brings tears to my eyes. I love the flying scene, the scene where Rose jumps out of the lifeboat to be with Jack, the scene where Jack dies and the very end when she dies. The music in those scenes are heartbreaking though. The bottom line, TITANIC IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!</p><hr><p><b>abbie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think the Titanic is very sad, I watch it every day that's how much I love it.

Even though I own a copy. I can't bring myself to watch it. For one the whole thing is made up i.e. not real except for the only real bit in the whole movie, the ship sinks. Thats it, all the rest is dribble. Jack is a fake as is Rose. This is a chick flick if I ever heard of one. The more hype they put on a movie makes me want to see it even less. And the fact I can't stand Leo is another matter. They might have used Brad Pitt or Justin Timberlake for the role of Jack would it have made a difference? I don't think so. Let's face it, men are from Mars, girls are from Venus. Women love sappy love stories with happy or sad endings. Guys like action, adventure, sci fi, blood guts gore etc.</p><hr><p><b>Mrs Emma Dicaprio</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is directly aimed at Jim Slater, I think the only way I can describe you is by a quote from Titanic "you unimaginable bastard" I HATE YOU! I am crying as write I this in hatred for you. This movie is dedicated to those on titanic, it is a great tribute and you and any other snotty nosed creeps that bad mouth it should be ashamed of themselves. Why are you even on this site if you dont like the movie huh? Don't you have better things to do than make a 12 year old cry! I love this movie, I am dedicated to it. I draw pictures and dream about it every nite. I watch the movie almost every day it is my life, I cry for fictional characters and all those who lost their lives in the tragedy.

We are taken on an emotional and physical journey with Jack and Rose as they fall in love on a doomed ship.</p><hr><p><b>Patrick, UK</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>First of all I want to declare that despite me being a boy I must say Titanic is and will continually be the most gripping film I've ever seen. Please don't stereotype me as some 'soppy' individual. I like the film not just based on the plot, although I admit it's undoubtedly a flawless masterpiece, but the elegantly and seamlessly interwoven finer elements such as the characters, script etc. Cameron certainly possesses the gift in establishing characters' role with the audience. The whole film from beginning to end keeps you fully anticipated - it feels so vivid as though you were on board. You are oblivious to the 3 hours if you're emerged into this world of love, hate, joy, desolation, courage and fear. Research and accuracy of details are impeccable - just look at the sets! Special Effects can be rivalled with current advances - 9 years on! Nevertheless, the part that keeps me (and most girls ;-)) is the emotional aspect. I'm not just referring to love but also each character's trauma they must have experienced on that heart-wrenching night. Whether young or old, high or low class, male or female - it didn't matter. The cast and acting were good though nothing exceptional but are certainly capable of bringing out the spirit of the film at the same time earning your appreciation. The reason for the film being "The highest grossing film of all time" is truly dependant on the spectrum of emotions you experience as you are sucked into this fictious yet non-fictional world. I think the film has a profound message in its essence. Characters are portrayed as though on a stage of life. Going through life trying to find its meaning. During the course you learn and gain. Sometimes you can't seem so find the meaning despite possessing everything you want. You have to stay focused. Everyone should live their lives to according their meaning. People had died that fateful night. The film in my opinion tried to address and acknowledge this by allowing us an insight to what happened. Survivors had to move on. We are the same, whatever happened in the past, the future is always bright. The metaphor works very well in describing human arrogance (unsinkable), we musn't be trapped by the joys or sorrows of the present as it immediately fades into the past. The next moment in your life is indefinate and infinite. Rose fully understood this. Listening to James Horners graceful song fully sends the message. The film is both sad but hopeful. Very warming indeed. Future directors and writers will have to work hard to challenge Titanic's unique mesmerizing emotional quality. Everyone has different opinions and I respect them. The best film so far.</p><hr><p><b>Princess</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Jim Slater, what an angry little Brit you are. Grow up and get over the fact that we Americans saved your sorry asses in WWII. If it was not for us, you would be speaking German right now. And the movie was NOT supposed to be a documentary truly representing historical facts. As in regards to Officer Murdoch shooting himself. There were people on the ship who stated that he did in fact kill himself. So James Cameron did not make it up, it is just one interpretation. Does someone really need to explain to you that movies are just make believe? Idiot.</p><hr><p><b>Christina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie.

Would you care to explain how, exactly, the USA came to our rescue when our island fortress was being bombarded night and day by the Luftwaffe in 1940? It didn't. That's the short answer for you. The RAF prevailed against all the odds and Britain, standing in isolated defiance against the German war machine, registered the Allies' first major victory against Hitler's campaign and forced a rethink of his entire military masterplan. The tide turned in Europe because of Britain and Britain alone. Foreign voluntary pilots, comprised mainly of Poles for obvious reasons, played their part in the victory. But not the USA. American popular opinion at the time was not very supportive of the UK, which it viewed as a trading competitor, and was strongly against involvement in the war in Europe. The British people were being murdered and terrorised long before America was dragged into the war - and even then the spark was not a bombing raid on mainland USA! Considering such cowardice and betrayal, I've never understood our countries' 'special relationship'. So don't even start on that until you've learned your history. I imagine that will be difficult though, with all the doctrine you are force fed in that flag waving, anthem singing culture of yours! P.S: I'm not normally this aggressive in response but that kind of talk still touches a raw nerve.</p><hr><p><b>Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
You might also see that only seven brave pilots from the US volunteered to help the RAF in its defence of the UK, compared to 139 from Poland and 86 from Canada. Even the French managed to send us 13 pilots  but America has them eternally labelled as cheese-eating surrender monkeys!

That may sound like a little chicky twirp thing, and I may be a gurly but here's why. Okay, true it may be probably "For girls" but it's not entirely a chick flick. It has action, romance, tragedy. It's not 100% predictable. If it was, Jack would be saved and it would be handy-dandy. But no, this is the story of two separate beings brought together in a ship. They fall in love and face tragedy, so yes this movie is great.</p><hr><p><b>Somebody</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really enjoyed the start of the movie where they show you the actual ship.

But I have to wonder how this movie would have ended if Jack survived.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Let me just say that this is by far THE BEST movie that I have ever seen but if anyone would like to hear this, I would like to tell you a very descriptive summary of how I think this movie should have ended if the ending was intended to be a happy one. First off I was a bit disappointed and sad about the death scenes of Tommy, Fabrizio, and Officer Murdoch. So what I came up with is this: instead of Tommy being killed by Murdoch, Cal does, because Murdoch is pissed off at him for not keep his bargain and finally sees Cal the way that Rose does so Murdoch doesn't feel bad about killing him so he doesn't kill himself. Tommy and Fabrizio don't die (I haven't come up with a good way that Fabrizio was saved). Now that Cal is dead he won't interrupt when Jack is trying to convince Rose to get on the lifeboat. Rose does get on and stay on the boat only because Jack tells her that he loves her and tells her that if she loves him like he hopes she does that she will get on and stay on. Jack is able to get on a boat because a first class passenger opts to go down with the ship so he tells Jack to take his spot on the boat. When they reach the Carpathian Rose starts frantically looking for Jack and spots him and runs up to him and they embrace and she tells him that she loves him. THE END (I know it sounds cheesy but I really love this movie!).</p><hr><p><b>reda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have ever seen. I don't think that anybody can do more than this, it is a perfect movie. Thank you James Camron, actually my rating is 100000000 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>skeeter boy</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>The way they put the movie was rather dumb. An old lady telling a story? They should have done it from that time. Oh well. The main good part is at the end when the ship sinks and people fight for survival. Can't believe how good it did at the box office. I didn't see it. I wonder why?</p><hr><p><b>Erolas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Don't say this movie was bad, it was so great! I watched it with my girlfriend and she was crying. It was amazing.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think Titanic is a wonderful film and it makes you feel sad when you think all of this happened in real life. When it comes to the part when Rose lets Jack go underwater I have tears in my eyes.</p><hr><p><b>sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script is amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Love</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I understand that everyone has their own opinion, and I respect that but to say that the acting of Leo and Kate Winslet sucked, I can't believe that. This movie was so beautiful. How they both loved each other and Jack dies for Rose and they are only 17! There aren't many 17 years old who have true love for each other. This movie is my favorite forever and ever and deserves all the awards it got. I cry like crazy when I watch this and I know many of you do too.</p><hr><p><b>Sravya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Titanic is the best movie I ever saw. If I had a chance, I would give it a billion stars!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Love, I agree with you because I thought the same thing because they had only known each other for 3 days and suddenly Rose comes out and says that she loves Jack. Actually Jack was 20 and Rose 17. But Cal was 30!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Is it just me or does it seems totally unfair and sort of against the rules that Lovejoy was able to carry a gun with him on a ship? He should have gotten caught or at least Cal should have for shooting at Jack and Rose. Did Cal really want to kill Rose too or just Jack? But who would want to kill such a HOT guy like Leonardo DiCaprio!</p><hr><p><b>Anna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. When Jack died at the end I cried for a whole week!</p><hr><p><b>mesfin wodajo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have seen in 'TITANIC' how a true love can bond two souls to the extent that even death couldn't separate it.</p><hr><p><b>Joey S.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks but there is only one little tiny thing, 3 HOURS LONG. I went to the movies all excited and everything and then I realize that I didn't get out of the theatre until 3 hours and 15 minutes later. Besides Jack and Rose didn't exist so why put them in the movie to make it more interesting. The only thing that really happened in that movie is THE BOAT SANK. ALSO WHY DON'T THEY MAKE A SEQUEL IT WOULD MAKE MILLIONS. It could be about they find Jack in the ocean frozen in a block of ice, they take him to a laboratory and unfreeze him. He comes back to life but it is the year 2006. That's seems like the future sine 1912. But then he finds out that Rose is dead but doesn't believe it. He sets out for an adventure to find Rose and finds out the truth. Rose is gone and only can be found in his memories. Or at least that's what I think.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>All I can say is: Star Wars was good, LOTR was good, Pirates was good, Harry Potter was good but Titanic was GREAT! The #1 movie for me.</p><hr><p><b>Leanardo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey Princess I am with you what the heck does Jim Slater think he is saying? The movie is based on Rose and Jack just because it took place on the Titanic doesn't mean the movie has to be about real life people and the people who were on it and I hope you are reading this Jim Slater because you are a real IDIOT WHAT THE HELL DO YOU CARE! I would like to see you try to write a movie as good as Titanic, yeah that is what I thought you can't know why because you are an IDIOT! And all those things that you said about Leonardo and Kate who cares how they are. You are probably just JEALOUS JEALOUS! And another thing I would like to see you say all those things you said to Leonardo's face!</p><hr><p><b>mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Joey S, you are quite right there is a short trailer now out called Titanic 2: Jack's back. Exactly that. Jack is found frozen in an ice cube at the bottom of the sea is brought back to life like Sylvester Stallone in that movie with Wesley Snipes. What the heck was it called, no matter. Very well done but only 5 min long.</p><hr><p><b>Elisha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I just want to say to all you haters that. You are IDIOTS! Titanic is the best movie of all time. If you say it sucks then you must not have seen the statistics. It is the highest grossing movie in the United States! The music even won and award! It had great actors. And if you think that people freezing to death in icy water is funny, then you need a reality check, because I'm sure if you were freezing your ass off in the Atlantic you wouldn't be laughing!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Is that right? A sequel? 5 minutes long? What's the point of making a sequel out of a movie that basically is already done with. I mean it would be cool to have a sequel but only if maybe Jack hadn't die or if Rose wasn't that old already while telling the story.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a message for all you haters that comment badly against this movie. All I will say to you as in a quote from the movie: "There will be one less person on this site if you don't shut that hole in your face!". Now I mean it, no one should be allowed to talk trash about this movie. This is the best movie ever made and no one should make fun of this real life tragic event. And by the way that quote really makes me laugh every time, it's funny.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If this interests anybody to know that the other day I was watching the history of Titanic on TV and it was about a certain group of researchers whose base ship was called the Keldysh (sound familiar?) and one of the guys described that the cold water felt like "knives stabbing you all over your body"(sound familiar too?).</p><hr><p><b>Miles Jart</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>C'mon, the way some of you people defend this movie is bordering on insanity !
I applaud Mr. Jim Slater for his comments even though I don't neccesarily agree with (all of) them. The way the fans rabidly savage him says a lot about human nature. It's almost the same as the way people turn on each other at the end of this film when their true nature is revealed under dire circumstances. Of course, this is only hinted at& not played upon much. The main tragedy is of course secondary to the soggy romance. However, I found this movie fairly enjoyable despite being overlong& okay, as a romance, quite engaging. Hey. I waited almost ten years to see it but could finally stand no more to hear 'What! You Haven't seen it?' So I saw it. Next!</p><hr><p><b>Catriona</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed the film because of the plot. I daren't write anything else in case I get good old Jim Slater (who is clearly an intellectual genius) ranting at me. I am terrified of him. I am only 13. But I do agree with him over the WWII (or was it WWI?) thing. The Americans DID NOT save us. And Princess, it was gramatically incorrect to put 'we saved you', seeing as you had no part in it whatsoever.</p><hr><p><b>Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Hey, I'm sorry. Let's bury the hatchet (Boy I'd like to bury a hatchet in Leo Di Caprio's mis-shapen head!).</p><hr><p><b>Catriona</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Mr Slater there. Leo is a useless pretty boy and I've found things that can act better in my brother's sock drawer. I've decided to change my rating to 5 .

p. S. People who say Leo can act are SO ANNOYING. It is useless trying to argue with me there, I can fight for hours.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You know, Jim Slater and all the rest of you haters I don't really care much for y'alls opinions because even though this movie is almost 10 years old it is still 'the greatest movie of all time'. Even though Leo D is over 30 he is still pretty hot. So now that I have this movie on DVD I intend to give it all the viewing it deserves. And Catriona if that's what you want 'to fight for hours' I can do that too!</p><hr><p><b>LeoLover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was the best thriller and love story I have seen in my life. It was good to see the gorgeous Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack) act. Kate Winslet my favorite actress act as well. James Cameron done a brilliant job. I REALLY REALLY enjoyed it.</p><hr><p><b>bellavalenz</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Thank you Jim Slater for providing so much amusement on a dull Friday afternoon. Have you ever considered entering the film critic profession or perhaps comedy? The reactions you receive are seriously entertaining! In regards to the film, I really quite enjoyed it in a depressing& somewhat tearful way! One thing that this blockbuster film does do is bring to life the basic story to many who may otherwise have lived life in historical ignorance.</p><hr><p><b>gyulia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey, Jim Slater since you enjoy bashing Leo I want to see if you can do your best bashing Billy Z. Or rather mainly his character, because personally I hate Cal (but not really Billy Z.) Deal?</p><hr><p><b>michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is SO great. It makes me cry EVERY time. It's very intense, but so good. Leo di Caprio was perfect for his role, and kate winslet was perfect for her role. They were great at acting each part. Awesome movie, greatest of all time.</p><hr><p><b>Mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I am glad to see other people feel Leo can't act his way out of a paper bag. Sure Leo is cute if it were only about looks. Acting forget it! Now enough of Leo, I will give you this the movie was very well done. However, not all that historically accurate that is why I rate it a 2. Way to over Hollywoodized. It does tell the story in a way. But you have to remember that Jake and Rose are really irrelevant to the story. They are fictional that is made up in somebody's head. Not real, imaginary etc. The real lady of the story is the Titanic herself! You should not lose focus of that.</p><hr><p><b>Brittney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I watch it every weekend. You can never get sick of it! Even though most of the characters are fictional doesn't make it a bad movie. James Cameron was trying to showcase how rich families were back then and used Leo and Kate to portray that. They weren't telling Jack and Rose's story in particular because again they weren't real people he was just trying to show what really happened the night when Titanic sank and he wouldn't have been able to do that without a 1st person point of view in the movie. If there had been a narrator other than the old rose telling her experience the movie would have had no point. I'm glad it was Leo and Kate. They have real chemistry in the movie and the passion looks so real. Anyone who says Leo or Kate or anyone else in this movie can't act, they should go screw themselves because I would personally like to see them do a better job. The movie is magical. Kudos to everyone involved you've made a classic.</p><hr><p><b>michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yea, it is supposed to be fake, because we don't really know what the people did on it, but jack and rose made the movie great. I love this film and it is the best ever.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have to say that I can't believe that they put characters like Cal, Ruth, and Lovejoy in the movie. I know that there has to be antagonists in movies but this combo of antagonists is CRAZY! Let me first start off by talking about Cal. Well, my first comment/question is: Is he bipolar or something? I mean in the beginning of the movie he is introduced as a well educated, rich guy. Yet he becomes uptight and almost criminal later. He tries to pretend like he cares about Rose (like when he gives her his coat and caresses her face but is quickly intervened by Jack. Go Jack!). And what if he actually wanted to kill Rose too when he shoots at her and Jack? Now about Ruth, well let me see. I was a bit confused by her quote, "Charmed I'm sure" when Rose introduces her to Jack. What kind of greeting is that? It must be totally annoying and depressing to Rose that her mother has to remind her everyday that "the money is gone". She obviously is the one that is selfish. Lovejoy's purpose in the movie is to keep Cal in check yet it seems that no one can control Cal. Cal did not want any help and did not seem to care that he left Lovejoy to die. Is there some kind of reason why James Cameron named him Spicer Lovejoy. I mean the words love and joy are happy words and spicer is like spice matching his personality. Hmm. Weird character but still the best movie ever!</p><hr><p><b>Person</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think people are allowed their own opinions, They may not like it because it is not their type of movie or they may disagree on some of the plot. I enjoyed Titanic and the movie got me interested in learning more on who actually was on the ship and some events that might be true or false. Going back to the topic of some others not liking the movie, I don't think you should write things like 'it was so bad' and not putting a reason why. I think it would help us understand why you didn't like the film if you put an explanation. I do think some of the plot was a bit exaggerated but that's only because it's a movie, you need to exaggerate things to interest the crowd.</p><hr><p><b>avery </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. It has so many deep messages. And the love story and Jack and Rose's chemistry is unbelievable. James Cameron, best director. This is my favourite movie. The effort that went into making this movie is superb. No movie can ever replace this masterpiece.</p><hr></td>
