Great acting and awesome directing. The visuals are fantastic.

It's been driving me crazy, but in the theatrical version (not the extended one), when they are at the Black Gates of Mordor, Sauron says 2 words  to Aragorn, but all I can make out is "Aragorn ....." I've listened and listened and while I know in the extended version he taunts them with Frodo's milthreal armor and claims he's dead, what Sauron says in the theatrical version isn't as long;  just 2 words.  Can someone tell me what it is that he says?</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>
I can't be entirely sure, but I think Sauron is saying: "Shite film, eh?"</p><hr><p><b>Keep.ur.fancy.ales</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic movie; well thought out and planned. Excellent, excellent!</p><hr><p><b>Rita</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A total kick-ass movie!</p><hr><p><b>Linda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I found out what Sauron says to Aragorn at the end.  He says  "Aragorn......Elessar".</p><hr><p><b> Galladriel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Totally the best movie ever</p><hr><p><b>no1 fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i watch this movie once a week since it came out, me and my best mate are the no1 fans and kno the entire script off by heart for all movies.

           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

The most beautiful part. I will forever love Billy Boyd because of that. Oh yeah the movie was great.</p><hr><p><b>Ally</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant!</p><hr><p><b>The Green Dragon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think it was THE BEST FILM in the whole wide world! I love it muchly! I'm 12 and I got the three movies for christmas and I LOVE THEM! I once watched it and then it ended so I watched it again! Thats kind of obsessive but I don't care I still love it!</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Loved the 'Fellowship of the Ring' but these last 2 were horrible. I despise lazy filmmakers and that CGI garbage. I don't care what anyone says, when you can tell it's a special effect then you know it sucks.</p><hr><p><b>Jasper</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Very good movie! Although I like the previous 2 more. This one is just fight, and there's hardly any story left. But what's in is very good!</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Masterpiece, beautiful in itself. It's the best movie of all time and there is no doubt nor question of that!</p><hr><p><b>Raptor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Just the best! For those who said it was bad, only one thing: Can any ONE of you make a better movie? Answer: No, not even any other directors.</p><hr><p><b>g thomas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The lord of the rings is just an absolutely amazing film, I love it so much it's got to be the best film in the world. I watch it every day, no one can make another film any better definitely 10 stars.</p><hr><p><b>Ray</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved it. All three were amazing! I watch them all the time. Definitely the best movie around.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The greatest epic EVER!</p><hr><p><b>Nat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hands down this is the best movie ever!</p><hr><p><b>Lord Saumil Aher</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Excellent piece of work, covering all the aspects that motion pictures need to have. PJ's always been my favorite director. I knew this man had qualities to do much more when I first saw Frightener. LOTR may it be. Thanks Peter and all the crew of LOTR. Nothing gets better than LOTR.</p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Arguably the best movie trilogy ever. I love all three and I am OBSESSED with them, especially scenes involving Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan (as the hobbits). I've even reenacted the scene (with my good friend) when the two of them are trying to set off "The Big One" the firecracker. Excellent acting and I'm glad the movies didn't stray from the book too much. J.R.R. Tolkien would have probably enjoyed watching the movies. His LOTR trilogy books are my favorite ever, not like the garbage out today. I LOVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS!</p><hr><p><b>sefgvfgv</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can I just say to Kat that I hate you for saying this movie sux - 'very distasteful'?? - you're distasteful. This movie is fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>Katie Torretti</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Lord of the Rings is the best movie I have ever seen. I have bought it and have watched it many times. I will keep watching it for the rest of my life.</p><hr><p><b>LOTR OWNS YOU</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>May I express my confidence in the good lord that Kat, Limey and Jesse are condemned to the deepest pits of hell for bagging LOTR. It's people like you who make the world a worse place to live. I look forward to peeing on your graves when an angry mob tears you limb from limb.</p><hr><p><b>Ed</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best epic ever! Hats off to Peter Jackson and all his crew.</p><hr><p><b>haz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't know what to say other than nothing could make this film better than it already is. Peter Jackson is a complete legend, when I'm watching all 3 films I cry because I am completely emotionally involved with my characters. Nothing else compares to this. Thanks to all the crew and producers for making a legendary piece of art.</p><hr><p><b>Arwenlas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Is there anything more to say? If you don't watch it, you really miss something!</p><hr><p><b>beb, master of pens</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's one of the greatest movies that ever existed. I don't know how anyone alive could ever miss this. Even though it's 3 and a half hours long.</p><hr><p><b>Marissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite movie of all time, just love it. Truly memorable, I'm kinda obsessed with it really.</p><hr><p><b>Legolas Fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved these movies because they are full of adventure, action and excellent actors/actresses. Elijah Wood was wonderful along with Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job. Anyone who doesn't like these movies is crazy.</p><hr><p><b>ring bearer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have ever seen! My friends and I all love it more than any other movie. Every year we hold a marathon where we pull an all nighter watching LOTR and we even have a club! These movies rock my world.</p><hr><p><b>megan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies I've ever seen! The music, scenes and characters are so detailed, it is as if middle-earth is actually real.  My brother and I watch it alot and it never gets old. A fantastic movie! </p><hr><p><b>Tolkien fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved all 3 of them. Totally the best movies I have seen and probably ever will see.</p><hr><p><b>Loubna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The lord of the rings the return of the king may be long, but my butt going numb was definitely worth it. The movie was really good and showed so much meaning. I myself fell in love with Billy Boyd when he sung that song. He has such a nice voice! I have watched all movies at least 300 times. Ok maybe 100, but no matter how many times I have watched it I never get sick of it. I personally rate it second best, next to Harry Potter.</p><hr><p><b>Joelio</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie. I think it ties directly with King Kong as a 10/10. Great job Peter Jackson, YOU ARE MY ROLE MODEL!</p><hr><p><b>Loubna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best bit in the movie goes to Pippin! I loved when he sang that song! I seriously fell in love with him. I just hate that Denethor guy for not taking in the meaning of his words. I wholeheartedly understood every word he said and I also understood his song. "Well, yes, I mean well enough for my own people. But we don't have songs for great halls and, evil times". One of the all time best lines I have ever heard. WELL DONE PIPPIN!</p><hr><p><b>Sahra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! It's so great! I'm a very big fan. LOTR was so fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>Obi-wan Kenobi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The only problem I have with this site, is all the nay-sayers! How can you give Return even a nine?! It is so much better than that. I support all you people who love it. The Paths of the Dead kept me on the edge of my seat and the battle at Pellenor feilds was the best. But so sorry it has to come to an end. Quen Corma a sanye tien ilya, Quen Corma a tuv tien, Quen Corma a tuc tien ilya, ar esse I huine gwedhi tien. Just the best movie. Idiots to all who don't like it!</p><hr><p><b>Fat man scoop</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Lord of the Rings was the best film in the world, better than Star Wars.</p><hr><p><b>Elfwarrior</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LUV this movie! It is the BEST movie ever in my opinion. I think everybody did a GREAT job making this movie. I wish there were more than three movies.</p><hr><p><b>orodreth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>LOTR is the best movie I've ever seen. Especially the elves.</p><hr><p><b>mrsaragorn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have to agree, I love lord of the rings. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they are talking about. It is a cinematic masterpiece and peter jackson has led it brilliantly to this. I think the cast did a brilliant job. Every single actor has played their role immensely well. I have to give extra credit to viggo mortensen who played aragorn for acting so unbelievably well but then again all the hobbits and everyone else were brilliant. You really cannot imagine anyone else in these roles my favourite part has to be aragorn mastering the palantir in the extended version 'long have you hunted me, long have I eluded you, no more, behold the sword of elendil!' love it!</p><hr><p><b>adrian</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Great script. I particularly like frodo's v/o towards the end. To the person who said when CG is noticeable it's a bad movie, that is so wrong. Special effects aren't what makes a movie, a movie is special effects and scripts and soundtracks all bound together. Besides, it takes some great skill to do effects as impressive/exciting/believable as those in LotR. Since I bet the people that worked on it spent months and months perfecting the effects, I hope you will stop prejudicing and look at the bigger picture.</p><hr><p><b>aragornlover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my gosh! This movie rocks! Love when the girl saves her dad in battle from guy no man can kill, for I am no man. I cried on that part along with others. Viggo will you marry me?</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie! I just love to watch the bonds of friendship that were made throughout the movies with the characters, especially between Legolas and Aragorn. One of my fave parts is when they are fighting at the Black Gate and one of the Orc dudes is almost about to kill Aragorn and Legolas is screaming and trying to get to Aragorn so he can save him from being killed.</p><hr><p><b>jdvmfan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>AWESOME! THE BEST ACTORS IN THE WORLD (except Orlando Bloom) I don't like him very much! Doesn't get ANY better. Best of the Trilogy! A ten is WAY too small a number. I give it a 1000+. 'Lay down your sweet and weary head, night is falling and you have come to journey's end sleep now and dream of the one's who came before, they are calling from across the distant shores, why do you weep, what are these tears upon your face, soon you will see, all of your fears will pass away, safe in my arms you're only sleeping, what can you see, on the horizon? Why do the white gulls call? Across the sea, a pale moon rises, the ships have come to carry you home. And all will turn, to silver glass, a light on the water, and all souls pass into the West.'- Annie Lennox is wonderful.</p><hr><p><b>*k-lin*</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Without a doubt the greatest movie ever made! I fell in love with so many of the characters and have 99% of the movies memorized. I can't stop watching them! How can you not like this movie? I mean come on! I think all of the positive comments on here can't even begin to express how amazing this movie is. It's a movie that will be remembered and cherished forever! Great work! *in love with Haldir (craig parker) and Frodo (elijah wood).</p><hr><p><b>ikneeltopeterjackson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My gosh it just does not get better. Peter Jackson is such a skilled person, I look up to him and I hope to only be just as good as him someday (pretty impossible). The acting was great. The great shots and angles just make the movie a billion times better. Awesome special effects, especially the balrog and my absolute favorite Gollum. I have not yet found a movie that even matches up to half of the trilogy and one day I would love to meet Peter and follow in his shadow till I even get a 1/3 of his skill then I would be the most happy person in the world.</p><hr><p><b>Andres Salazar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Greatest achievement ever put on celluloid. It has a very special place in my heart.</p><hr></td>
