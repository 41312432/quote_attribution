I tried to think of something that rhymed with 'freedom' and could only come up with Edam. 

So, if there's ever a movie about an uprising in Netherlands, the inspirational leader may make the battle cry - 'They may take our lives but they'll never take our Edam'!

Good film but historically a crock of shit. Robert the Bruce was the true hero in the Wars of Scottish Independence!</p><hr><p><b>Highlander</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Robert the Bruce is the true hero? Wow! Do you need a history lesson! The Bruce was a fence sitter. He waited until Wallace was out of the way. He waited close to 11 years after Wallace's death before he stepped forward for Scotland. He didn't do it while Wallace was alive because Wallace was a commoner and the Bruce didn't want anything to do with a commoner. Where did you think the saying came up with the saying "So-and-so The Bruce" when that so-and-so is a fence sitter?</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>True, Robert was a ‘fence sitter’ during the life of William Wallace. But bear in mind the guy was a politician, whose noble peers had no appetite for war, feeling it would only jeopardise their titles and perhaps even their lives. Everyone around him, all those corrupt and very influential people, sided with the English!

Does it not show remarkable strength of character that he did eventually cast these traitors off, stripping them of their titles and their lands?

Wallace had none of these considerations. He could afford to wear his heart on his sleeve. Having nothing, being allowed nothing, means you stand to lose nothing. But the Bruce was no less a patriot or a hero because of his position.  

And let’s not forget, that just as Wallace inspired the first wave of rebellion against the English, so too did Robert pick up the Scottish flag from the ashes when all seemed lost and charge forth with it.  

This man came out of hiding in his cave and rallied and carried Scotland to its independence. Wallace was an immense hero. But when he was beaten at Falkirk, his legend was diminished while still alive. After his death, the Bruce was entirely alone to fulfil Wallace’s legacy. And that he did. 

History lesson? I know my history mate, I just take a completely different view and it owes nothing to the fodder in a Mel Gibson epic. 
</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Dude this was tight.</p><hr><p><b>Musica101</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Good movie, not in my fave fifty but something I'd watch again.</p><hr><p><b>h-taj</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It was a good movie which reveals the scottish history.</p><hr><p><b>Mig</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't know an awful lot about the history, all I know is that this film is a classic. I have seen it over 300 times now and even still I find it awesome every time I watch it!</p><hr><p><b>robin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What is history but a point of view? Unless you were actually there, you would never know for sure what transgressed there. Oh yeah, great movie.</p><hr><p><b>James</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Very scary.</p><hr><p><b>Abraham</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I would call it as the best historical movie that creates a deep impact in the mind of every viewer. It may not be in accordance with history but still it makes us to believe the events. Great movie don't miss it.</p><hr><p><b>Robert</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A really great film, not too good historically, but the script and actors were great. But why was it filmed in Ireland, with an Australian actor? Surely they could have found a decent Scotsman to play Wallace? Patrick McGooghan is good as Longshanks though and Angus McFadden is a decent Bruce.</p><hr><p><b>Katrina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It had a few little flaws. But with every excellent film there must be a few. The scenery didn't look like Scotland, but that's just this Irish eye. The casting was excellent, and I wouldn't have changed it if I could.</p><hr><p><b>Helen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was a great movie. For all you history buffs: let's not forget that there is hardly any real historical material about Wallace's life left. Most of what we know is based on Blind Harry's poem, which was written in the 15th century (so quite a long time after the actual events took place). Even biographers of Wallace have used this poem in order to fill in the gaps of his life. And believe me, Blind Harry was only trying to rekindle the fire of Scottish nationalism by writing about a common man who fought and died for his country.</p><hr><p><b>Rhea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was beautiful. The music was outstanding, the acting was very believable, and I could go on forever. This is definitely one of my favorite movies.</p><hr><p><b>Gracie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film was so good, i cried when MEL GIBSON died. It's a fantastic story and I think that no other movie that MEL has been in, can top this! It is the ultimate movie.</p><hr><p><b>Kev</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the greatest movies ever made. There are only a few movies that can even compete with Braveheart.</p><hr><p><b>Billy Dennis</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>While this might be well written there is a line where history ends and the be. S. Begins in all historical based movies. This however started over the line and moved further and further as it went on. How do you have the battle without the bridge that's the whole battle. This is Crap. However We were soldiers was a great screen play and very grounded in the history.</p><hr><p><b>Steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>There is not much that is actually known about Wallace, but one thing is certain. The battle he won against the English was called the Battle of Sterling Bridge for good reason. The causeway/bridge across the Forth played a HUGE part in the battle, and Wallace's use of the land and bridge to defeat the English showed true generalship. Where is the bridge in Braveheart? Their Battle of Sterling (no Bridge) was a large disappointment. I understand the original script actually called for a bridge, but was canned because in cost too much.</p><hr><p><b>Monkey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think you missed the point of the film Limey, just because the Bruce had titles and land to lose how does that make more to lose than the common man who dies on the battlefield (actually quoted in the film). It wasn't a war of independance in anything because in the end scotland wasn't free, it was still an absolute monarchy. So there was a scottish king, but that didn't change for the commoner on a farm, they tried to instill 21st century thinking in a medieval setting. Nationalism didn't even exist back then, why would there you had nothing to gain out of it.</p><hr><p><b>Tina</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Yet another disgusting film filled with much frivolity, I think Mel Gibson just wanted to sate his sadistic urges by showing unlimited amounts of blood, gore, and inaccuracies just to defame William Wallace, Mel Gibson should never deserve to be called a "film director", least of all, one with a creative vision.</p><hr><p><b>Helen</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A classic film trying to acknowledge the depth to what Wallace believed in. He could afford to fight against the English as he no property to lose but was willing to give his life. The Bruce did gather the Scots against the English and fought hard and well if there was a traitor look towards the Bruce's Father who never showed his true colors. Robert the Bruce gained his name and stature once he became "King of the Scots". A moving film not the truth, we learned of Wallace in school but not as much as we were taught about the Bruce. If you wish to have knowledge then read your history and not believe all you see in a movie. Angus McFadyen made a great Bruce but would have made a better Wallace than Mel Gibson.</p><hr><p><b>Alessandro</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really like this movie and I would like to know what Wallace says after the saying in the Stirling battlefield :"...they will take our life, but they wont take our freedom". In the Italian version I can not understand if Wallace says, while it's starts to gallop, a Latin sentence. Do you know exactly the words of the sentences that I mean?</p><hr><p><b>Phil</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>To Tina & Robert,

Actually, Mel didn't want the role in the film, he just wanted to direct, but the studio wanted a big star and only green-lit the project once he agreed. As for why they didn't film in Scotland, no idea, probably a budget issue.

In terms of historical accuracy, this movie obviously misses the mark. However remember that this was not intended to be a historical documentary-though being accurate is always a bonus. The beauty of movies like these is that they inspire you about the subject matter, so, if you're interested, you can go research the real facts.

Great film, Mel did a great job directing - definitely part of the DVD collection.</p><hr><p><b>LordBravo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Aye, enough with the history.
Mel won Oscar for it and deserving one,An all time outstanding acting by him. Love him all the way. hes probably the only true war hero of Hollywood.

The pathos and tragedy blends with sophistication to romance and light comedy as well as historical puns and going deep in to a cause, Freedom. The script is good but its the acting and direction that makes the film one of the greatest of all times.

Lastly, if you are not touched at Wallace death scene, his fight for freedom and the revenge for his loved one, you miss a real HEART.

God Bless GOOD filMS</p><hr><p><b>Luther</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A very good film in my opinion. Inspired me to write a spec script called Knights, which I am currently trying to sell.</p><hr><p><b>victor dickson</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is the best definition of freedom-- there is nothing free in Freetown. Brave heart as a film transcends motion picture to grand reality. One of my best.</p><hr><p><b>Arron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies ever made, from acting, script, direction, story, ending etc. Unmissable picture. Movies are here to make us feel emotions as if we are part of the story, to inspire us and of course entertainment, so don't be getting so wound up about the historical evidence. The movie may have some historical figures in the plot but who ever said it had to tell a factual story of the goings-on. The movie is a fictional period piece with historical figures involved. The movie makes you care for the protagonist and his goals and support him against the antagonist not to tell you who did what I the 13th century. Enjoy the film and stop worrying about what really happened, if you want that start watching history channel programs.</p><hr><p><b>erin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The sentence Wallace says after "they may take our lives but they may never take our freedom" is "Argu Gu Brath" is definitely Scottish Gaelic I'm not 100% sure what it means but it's something along the line of Scotland forever I think.</p><hr><p><b>Kathy`</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Aaron. One of the best movies ever made. Tina, haven't you ever read a REAL history book? War has never nor will ever be pretty. Mr. Gibson's acting was superb, as usual. It takes a really talented person to make the audience feel emotions they see for the character on the screen.</p><hr><p><b>Ruth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I haven't seen the movie for years. Reading the screenplay was just as good. I still felt fear, tears, and passion at every page. I learned much abut screenwriting. Thank you. Brilliant! Respectfully, Ruth.</p><hr></td>
