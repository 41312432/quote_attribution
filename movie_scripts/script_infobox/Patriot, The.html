Agreed Seth - the scriptwriter should be shot, hung, drawn and quartered, the various body parts glazed in honey and thrown to the wolves, excreted, scraped up again, and slung into a raging inferno!!!  </p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>P.S: Then you'd really go to work on the bastard!</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Milo</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Just tried to watch this cowpat again the other night and switched off after about ten minutes. What a heap of steaming dung. </p><hr><p><b>tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a very, very good movie. It shows courage and HEART. It shows a man being a REAL MAN. Not just a male. It is for the love and respect of your country. Males in this country today should hope to be half the MAN that is displayed in this movie. A MAN with HEART, SOUL, a cause, a purpose, a battle to fight. (not a war but a reason). This is one of the greats.</p><hr><p><b>John Doe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The funny thing about this movie is that they made the British the bad guys. Don't get me wrong if was Amercian I'd be singing a different tone. But I can't help it if I'm Canadian and I'm of British origin. And how we kicked America's arse in 1812 after they became bold when they were done with their revolution. Now that's irony. It would be nice if they showed how some of the early Amercians treated the loyalists.</p><hr><p><b>Kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>1812? We BEAT you, and you ran home. You Brits tried TWICE to beat us, and you got your crumpet-crapping arses handed to you. Funny how everywhere the Brits tried colonizing (other than the Americas and Australia) is presently locked in an endless war and/or instability (various places in the Middle East. Thanks again for the Israel thing, Ireland, most of Africa, Taiwan...). Of course the Brits would be made out to be the bad guys in The Patriot, it was made in America. Are you still in primary school? The only thing you seemed to have gotten right was how the revolutionaries treated the loyalists. Either way, the point is moot because the only good part of this script was when Jason Isaacs got impaled with the American flag.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Kevin, this much is true- we Brits were bloody murdering tyrants across two thirds of the globe! But, while there were certainly many accuracies portrayed in this movie, I took exception to the usual Hollywood treatment of British characters, namely that they are all mincing tyrants in silk, mink and ermine, who bemoan having to soil their shiny boots upon the native women and children. It is a theme that persists in any US movie where villainous characters are to be drawn. Think Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Christopher Lee in, well, everything. And how about every Imperial officer in the Star Wars movies? It has to be said though, that the English-accented villain will always steal the scene from the American hero, as the actors cast in these roles are invariably stalwarts of the English stage.</p><hr><p><b>John Doe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Kevin look again dumb-ass! 1773-1783 was the time of the America revolution. 1812 was when America tryed to invaded Canada. You might have won the revolution. But after that, you guys thought you can conquor all of us (Brits). So you Yankees tried to takeover all of North America! We never got our arse handed to us in 1812. It was America that got raped !
You guys had huge force of 35, 000 regular troops and had even more militiamen, and we nothing! Just some left over troops from the revolution, and some of the local population even with that we just had a force of 8, 500 which was made up of France, English and Native Indians. You probably don't even know that your national anthem was a British drinking song before the revolution! You Yankees just changed the words! Man! You think you know enerything, but you're still a dumb-ass. The British might be trenched in blood, but America isn't any better. You Americans were being little nazi's in the 1700's and 1800's. Killing off the Native Indian population, enslaving the Black population and getting their hands bloody. Here's a list just for you, from the 1600's to all the way to the first Gulf war in 1991 .

The list just keeps going and going and going and I'm to lazy to type it all down. You know another cool part in the movie was when the guys head got shot off by a cannon ball. So even they didn't show the other side to the movie, it was still good.</p><hr><p><b>Sean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie and Robert Rodat I loved your work on SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.</p><hr><p><b>wolfenstein</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I thought it might interest that damn yank that the brits managed to destroy the original white house in 1812- the brits certainly scored points in that war. Also, those damn yanks never credit the french for creating their nation in 1783. It was the french, NOT the yank rebels, that helped america gain independence from the english. The yanks were absolute ratshit and couldn't even fight a decent battle on open ground against british regulars, the yanks had to hide in the forest with their little peashooters and snipe british supply convoys- thus the cowardly way of waging war. Only in 1783 did things change when the french fleet arrived at yorktown, virginia and laid waste to cornwallis' forces but up until then the war was in british favor. And hey, also got to agree with the last comment by john doe, although it puzzles me why a pome would use a yankee name (john doe is a name given to unidentified american war dead until they're identified) the yanks thought that since they had their own nation they could just simply walk into other territories and take over peacefully. Instead, in the two hundred and four years since america's independence, the US of A has caused nearly every single war in history from that time- they ultimately got themselves caught in world war one for example and got themselves entangled in world war two as well- in world war one, america, which was supposedly NEUTRAL, was supplying the brits in france with ammunition and weapons etc by way of transporting that shit over the Atlantic in PASSENGER vessels. The germans weren't the bad guys when they sunk the lusitania, the americans were for transporting that shit on a passenger liner while maintaining a faux neutrality. Bloody yank bastards will never wash 200 years worth of blood and gore off their hands. And as much as I hate to say this, they are now currently fighting a losing war against terrorism and the irony is they gave the terrorists the means to commit all these crimes. Maybe, just maybe, these yanks are getting comeuppance for their crimes against humanity (another comment that I shouldn't have made but I think it needs to be said and it is a right of mine to have a personal opinion of this subject). Anyways, I've said my piece and gotten it all off my chest I don't want to offend anyone at all by saying all this but I think it needed to be said regardless.</p><hr><p><b>Col. Tavington</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I know most people root for the good guys, but not me. Every once in a while I root for the good guys, it depends on the situation. I love this movie for one reason and one reason only...Colonel Tavington! I live in America and I love my freedom but I was rooting for Col. Tavington the whole time. I love the intensity and the carelessness of the character! Jason Isaacs played this part so well!</p><hr><p><b>Bernard</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This movie was flawed and at times silly, but look. It isn't meant to be historically correct. It has Heath Ledger, and if anybody bags him, you will go to hell. Mel Gibson - Common, what more could you want? Filled with some nice violence and war, as well as drama, thrilling action and a whole lot of story and heart. Brilliant drama and performances make this an epic, yet subtle drama film. And easy 6/10 for me. Maybe a 7. But it was simply brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Leviosa</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>"Children, kids, onto the mats, it's time for your nap." Not much bothers me with the exception of pure unadulterated ignorance. It seems every person here is an 'expert'; however, might I suggest just a couple of matters? 1- Dates; when did America become legally America? Only the truly ignorant would assign a war to a nation that did not or doesn't exist. 2- When did Canada become a nation? The only difficulties I have with any Canadian is arrogance. Tone it down a bit. 3- Seems to me that only the United States Congress (and for you who don't know, and yes, there are many!) both houses, Senate and House of Representatives must declare such.  4- Most everyone residing in what would become the New England colonies, Middle colonies, and Southern colonies considered themselves "Subjects of the British Empire." The entire notion of "Rights" is something that was guaranteed to the British and as such it became a birth right. 5- Try and remember that there doesn't necessarily need to be a justifiable link between truth and fantasy when it comes to film-making. Hollyweird is known for their propaganda tactics. This notion is simply not new by any stretch of even your imaginations.</p><hr><p><b>Shadow Maiden</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this is one of the best movies ever made. It is an incredible view into the American Revolution. It is true that not every British officer was like evil like that, but some were. Hey, and if you have a problem with me, I don't care because I have English blood in me and I have reason to believe that at that time that my family were for the British cause. Whatever. You don't choose family, but you do choose what you do. 

The acting here was brilliant! Everything was inspiring, heart-wrenching, and heroic. Brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Jim</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie.  They'll be making a sequel set in the year 2010, unless this inexperienced socialist is kept in check.  Can't comment any further, I've got to get back to work so I can fund urban housing improvements, universal healthcare, and free escalades for everyone.</p><hr><p><b>mandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>
This movie is BRILLIANT! All of the actors (and actresses) played their parts exceedingly well. My favorite character would have to be the evil yet awsome Colonel William Tavington. And, reading down through these comments, I see that I'm not really the only one who approves of the Colonel and thinks he is really great. Anyway. If I had to choose the best actors in the movie, it would be Jason Iaasacs and Mel Gibson-Colonel William Tavington and Benjamin Martin. These two are always fighting. That's weird, isn't it? They just can't leave each other alone, can they? *Boys will be boys!* </p><hr><p><b>Robert</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>As a lawyer and a college professor, I am always amused at the number of people who seem to forget to, "remain siilent and a be thought a fool, but speak and remove all doubt".  LEVIOSA points out many of the facts lacking in the other comments  and these other comments   are opinions, not facts. They are neither accurate nor intellectual. They are the product of a lack of knowledge, laziness in research or ignorance. John Doe: Clearly you are ignorant of history. The wars you listed prior to 1776 were British wars. "America" as a country didn't exist until the British troops under Lord  Cornwallis surrendered. Until then, they were colonies under the British. And, it was British subjects, with the full approval and knowledge of Parliment that bought and sold slaves. It was british subjects who traded with the Native Americans and attacked them. The British have as much blood on their hands in history as any other country and more than most.</p><hr><p><b>Alissa G</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Hey look, I'm actually commenting on the script! AND IT'S UTTERLY HORRIBLE! This script is so outdated, they still have the main character down as Francis Marion instead of Benjamin Martin (They changed the character because of a controversy surrounding Francis Marion). Needless to say, if you are looking for a reliable, accurate source, this isn't it.</p><hr><p><b>Whatever</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It's a good movie. And more historically accurate than most people give it credit for. You see, people, in the movie business, or any creative industry, you use the facts that you need to use in order to tell the story you want to tell. The filmmakers weren't looking to make a documentary. It's called a DRAMA. The characters were not solely based on specific people that actually lived. Benjamin Martin's character was INSPIRED by a number of different people that were involved in the war. Tavington's character was INSPIRED by a cruel British colonel. And the Brits were depicted as cruel because (gasp.) they were America's enemies BACK THEN. And in most stories, you have the good guys and the bad guys. Narrative structuralism, look it up. And honestly, I do not even believe you people are arguing about stuff that happened nearly 250 years ago. Who kicked whose butt, who did what to whoever. You weren't there. And most of you don't even sound like you even know enough to give an educated opinion on the matter. Plus, most of what you're arguing about isn't even relevant to the MOVIE.</p><hr><p><b>flubndub</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>You people talking politics do realize that you are boring everybody who want to discuss movies and not weed our' way through an Internet nerd fight don't you? I don't think this movie is intended to be a history lesson. It's a action movie where we can see great Revolutionary War battles and Mel Gibson beat his' enemies with an iron tomahawk. The production values are high and it is well acted. The pace is good and the costumes are authentic. *WARNING SPOILER* The Americans win.</p><hr><p><b>p0rkch0pian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Emphasis, in The Patriot, is, duhh, patriotism. No better movie could be shown to the captive audiences [philosophical targets of teachers' unions] in America's government schools. The Patriot is a fine alternative to the politically correct crapola [what little there is] fed to the captives about the nature of our Revolution, and the nature of the early Americans who- with help from the French- extracted a surrender from Cornwallis at York Town. Everyone who hasn't experienced the eery feeling of looking over the field of battle at Yorktown needs to do so- as soon as possible. [Dedicated Obamanoids are welcome too, but might as well stay away.].</p><hr><p><b>Zach</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>No idea how anyone can say this is a bad movie. This is a classic. Some parts can get a little cheesy but a great movie none the less! Back when Mel was the MAN.</p><hr><p><b>jim calocci</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>We took on an enemy, we were not expected to win if we had to die, we had to do it ON OUR FEET what happened was not supposed to, AMERICA we can do it again, we need to find our FUTURE, OUR UNIQUENESS. This is a great movie, great performances, Gibson, a great story teller, sadly, often times, a jerk personally.</p><hr><p><b>The Road Gypsy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I am so glad to see the original script. When I saw this movie in the cinema, I actually stood up as the credits started to roll and shouted "Where's the chair??" I am surprised no one else has written about this. The set ups were there- opening with the lead character making a chair, half way through he is in the enemy's office amazed at the quality of his chair, then at the end- there was no chair. Now I can see that the studios obviously wanted a completely different ending- or maybe the director- but the writer, well, he did a good job. You are absolved of the wrongdoing. Maybe one day I will discover whose stupid idea it was to change the ending and not AT LEAST have a chair on the wagon at the barn raising, or someone giving him a chair to add to the wagon- anywhere. There needed to be a chair. Set ups with no pay offs make an unhappy audience.</p><hr><p><b>A commenter </b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>While I like the movie itself and thought the cast (especially Jason Isaacs) did well, this script is just terrible. I'm glad that they didn't use this draft as the shooting script. The movie: 9/10 This draft of the script: 1/10.</p><hr><p><b>Shameless</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I think it's a good movie for the most part, however 85% of the time I only watch it for Jason Issacs's portrayal of William Tavington.</p><hr></td>
