QOTD is my all-time favorite movie. I actually liked the love between Lestat & Jesse more in this script than in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Thank god no Tom Cruise! This film was cool, no not like the book but you can't have it all.</p><hr><p><b>danielle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Love it! It was so cool and sexual, as I love anything to do with vamps/sex 
I was so mesmerized.</p><hr><p><b>liely</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am to name my child Akasha!</p><hr><p><b>Milo</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>
Well Danielle, aren’t you just a walloping little sauce bottle? Tell me, are you vampy by nature or is it just the thought of some bloke sinking his fangs into your neck that gets you ‘mesmerised’. I'm rather partial to being bitten myself - just nibbled, mind you. 

Note to IMSDB: I do appreciate that it isn’t the right kind of forum for this sort of dialogue but hey, the girl deserves a reply. It would be rude not to.  
</p><hr><p><b>midnitedancer</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought that the movie was good, the music was great and Stuart Townsend as Lestat was amazing. I'm just confused as how in "Interview with a Vampire" Lestat was suppoed to have slept for 100 years, but he was awake at the end in the 90s. Explain that to me!</p><hr><p><b>NATALIE</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think Stuart Townsend makes a better Lestat than Tom Cruis but one thing bugs me. Make that three things bug me. In Interview with a Vampire they clearly point out that vamps can't change their appearence, so how does Lestat go from a bloned to a brunette? And why did they combine the two books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned to make this movie? And how come in the book Jesse is changed by Maharet and Mael when in the movie Lestat changes her? I still love the movie! I can recite the lines while watching it.</p><hr><p><b>Kelsey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. I really like vampires and I love Lestat! It is just one of my favorite you-can-watch-anytime-in-any-mood movies.</p><hr><p><b>arlene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree with just about every comment made. I did find a site with the origional script and spent 2 days writting it down(printer broken) Theone thing we should all hope for is that they come out with the directors cut on DVD. There is so much more sex, blood and rock and roll that was cut out and it would make a great tribut to Aalya. I too know every line not only of the movie, but the music. Stuart rocks and makes me only wish vampires really exsisted. It would be rad to be one. I know I am obsessed! At least I admit it. After all, vampires can be erotic, passionate, ruthless and cunning. Love them!</p><hr><p><b>Nicole</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>When I first saw queen of the damned I fell in love with it. My mum and dad think I'm nuts for watching the movie so much but I love to I find a new layer of the movie when I watch QOTF. I have file full of poems, pictures from scenes from Queen of the damned even the sountrack. Stuart T is so hot and Marguerite is really sexy too. I wish Stuart did more vampire movies they really suit him and Marguerite. I love the whole biting blood sucking theme it's so sexual and intimate. My blood rushes every time I see blood. Well it's my favorite movie (please make more).</p><hr><p><b>Aristia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Aaliyah's role was excellent and she really portrayed a great actor in this movie! I really looked up to her and will miss her forever.</p><hr><p><b>Eamonn Tutty</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I have to say this was one of the most anticipated movies at its time, however it was an absolute disgrace that it was not taken as seriously as Neil Jordan's interpretation of Interview with the vampire. It was overlooked as an incredibly constructed narrative and glossed over by an MTV Goth, Rock, emo culture that has been established with vampire novels that absolutely ruined the film on all levels.</p><hr><p><b>drusilla</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The first time I saw queen of the damned I was so surprised, I didn't think I would like it but I LOVE it. But since I love interview with a vampire I guess I like every vamp movie. I'm into vampires and only wish you'll make more vampire movies, especially with Stuart Townsend in them. He really does look hot as a vamp. As nicole said, please make more.</p><hr><p><b>brittany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie. In my opinion it was much more exciting than Interview with a Vampire and I love the Lestat and Jesse pairing.</p><hr><p><b>Drew</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>How can you all think this movie was good?. THE FILM WAS SO SHITTY. It ruined Anne Rice's work. It mutilated the storyline completely and reversed and deleted so much. To all of you who like this movie, man I feel so bad if you guys are calling your guys selves true Anne Rice readers when Anne Rice was and still is against this film. You would know that the movie had nothing to do with the novel. Idiots.</p><hr><p><b>Chris G</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Atrocious movie. Only 2% of Queen of the Damned is in the movie. They took the entire point and basis of that book and ripped it apart into nothing but a sad representation of what was not really more than a page here and there from a few chapters, leaving out every single important detail. This is the absolute worst vampire movie I've ever seen, even if you haven't read the book. Worse than Blade 3 by leaps and bounds.</p><hr><p><b>Samantha</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I have read the books (Queen of the damn being my least favorite), but I will pretty much tell it how it is in the matter of film. This movie was terrible. It was way overdone with the stupidity of 'rock star' vampires. Come on guys. I hate Tom Cruise, but for Lestat. I think he nailed it in Interview with the vampire. The idea of a BRUNETTE Lestat in Queen of the damned was almost nausiating. Plus, he doesn't hold the same sort of high end ideals as the Interview of the Vampire Lestat. Music was awesome. But that's about it. (Also, Marius is not Lestat Master. They should have at least done that right).</p><hr><p><b>Kat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Queen Of The Damned is amazing. Yes, when the voiceover sings for Lestat it isn't as good as it could be, but Stuart Townsend did an amazing job in the role of Lestat. And Samantha, he wasn't brunette, he was ash blonde, same as me so I should know. I'm glad they didn't recast Tom Cruise as Lestat, he was good in Interview with a Vampire but wouldn't suit this role. And you would think that 100 years of sleep would change you, don't you think? I reckon it's amazing, why else would I have watched it 6 times in 4 days, hmm?</p><hr><p><b>Kat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Arlene, I know all the words to the movie and the songs, I even have the lyircs to 4 of them, and can recite the script. And I can't believe how weird that made me sound.</p><hr><p><b>munchkins</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I didn't hate the movie but I was really disappointed by it. Queen of the Damned is my favourite Anne Rice vampire novel and they completely ruined it. They totally left out the story of the origin of vampires and they completely butchered the history of Mekare and Maharet and why they hated Akasha so much. I get annoyed even writing this. I think people who didn't read the book enjoyed the movie. I did like Stuart better than Tom as Lestat, Aaliyah was beautiful as Akasha (but that accent was like wtf), I hated that dude as Marius.</p><hr></td>
