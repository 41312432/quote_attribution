    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Clemence</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I alread knew the film by heart but I loved reading it ! Thank you :</p><hr><p><b>Stephanie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>wow! that script changed drastically in some ways from what we saw on the actual movie, I actually thought this script was better then what is on the movie now. This was a great script, I LOVED THE MOVIE! thanks</p><hr><p><b>Christina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's better than the film. Some of these scenes are wonderful (and what a pity some were cut).</p><hr><p><b>Layla</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Loved this script.  It was really nice to read some of the scenes that weren't in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>cher</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>well it wasn't too bad but i would've liked to see the firebolt scene much earlier as it originally is in the book. (but that would've meant seeing the quidditch interhouse chamionship which would've been a riot.) one part thought which is disjunct is the part where hagrid tells the trio about the trial. there was nothing mentioned before in the movie script about buckbeak being in trouble in the first place, which is pretty confusing to anyone who sees the movie. also, it wasn't clear how harry and hermione knew exactly where sirius is being kept, in the book dumbledore tells them where. also, why couldn't a line have been added where harry says to hermione, "we've got to fly on buckbeak up to sirius to set him free. sirius and harry can escape together." it wouldn't have taken very long. i wish the scenes with lavender and parvati would've been kept in the movie also. *sigh* oh well, on to HBP and movie 4. </p><hr><p><b>Trina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>wonderful movie! luved it :)</p><hr><p><b>Wade</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I'm really disapointed about the Firebolt not being shown to its full, but the rest was pretty good. It would have been better to show that Harry had been reading about () the Weird, that was very interesting. But what's done is done. P.S. I hated Hermione's wand!</p><hr><p><b>Georgina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was my favorite out of all the Harry Potter movies. It just seemed so... modern</p><hr><p><b>Gurdeep</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The overall movie waz great and all except for the Quidditch scene could have played a great roll in the movie!!The Quidditch played a big part in the book and i thought it could have played a big role in the movie and it would also have made the movie MUCH better not that it wasn't already but still!! The Quidditch scene would have sealed The Best Movie Of The Year Award and i think the Firebolt shud have been brought into the movie earlier like Mrs. Rowling did in her book!!Other than that The MOVIE waz fantastic and My Family and I enjoyed it very much i LOVED it it waz very gud directing and and producing!!</p><hr><p><b>Gordon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Okay,I tried immitating them but this is like more than what i asked for...Thank you imsdb...</p><hr><p><b>Halfblood Prince</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I really enjoyed the movie. Not as a Harry Potter movie, but justr an average movie. I am a big fan of the book so i was dissapointed that they cut out so much. I still thought it was a great movie and I bought it on DVD anyway.</p><hr><p><b>Harriet Potter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>the movie wuz great!!!!!!!! tho im dissapointed they cut out a lot, i loved the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i saw it  6 times and even bought tghe DVD! i cantr wait for 4 th movie!!! :)  </p><hr><p><b>Person</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Harry Potter rocks, yo!</p><hr><p><b>marc</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>its cool</p><hr><p><b>Hermione Granger</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>the movie was WICKED! the script was fantastic. I couldn't think of a greater way fo putting it. keep the progress up. I cant wait for the 4th movie and script to come out i will definitly...be seeing and reading that. i already reserved my copy of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE!
</p><hr><p><b>Ana Hidalgo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie so much. I can't wait till the forth one comes out. These movies just keep on getting better and better</p><hr><p><b>jasmine</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Evil movie</p><hr><p><b>Pue-Blood Princess</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this script! Everytime I watch the movie I have it printed off! I can't wait till The Goblet Of Fire comes out! Can't wait to read the HBP, I have it aswell as a evil dad who is making me wait until tuesday, so I can read it on the plane  :O! Anyway, keep up the script work!</p><hr><p><b>Tamara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the moevies , But the scriot is very good :-)))

p.s. i liked when hermione punched Draco</p><hr><p><b>Calum</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great, it really keeps getting deeper and deeper.</p><hr><p><b>Baxter Chamberlain</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>a good moive but not better than star wars</p><hr><p><b>Angelica</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is actually amazing. Nice story. In the book. A little bit in the movie.But it is actually both fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>O..M..G!I LOVE this movie!I own it,and 3 times a week just about,I watch it!Well if I have homework...but that's beside the point!Anyways,the movie was BRILLIANT!It was much much better than the other ones,but OOOMMMGG I cannot wait any longer for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!It is my FAVEOURITE book,so it must be my faveourite movie also..I have a Goblet of Fire wallpaper on my computer of Ron and Harry in Dress Robes!Lol..anyway,50 bloody days until that movie!It's just too much!Grrr.....I can't wait to see Harry in it!And Ron..OH I just LOVE Ron and Rupert Grint!Did you see him in the new Trailor?Professer McGonagall was like "Mr.Weasley,place your right hand on my waist."and then Ron was like "Where?"OMG it was so funny!Hahahaha!Rupert is soo cute!*Looks at Rupert Poster dreamily*</p><hr><p><b>Olivia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG!!! this movie is so frickin awsome!!!! Tom Felton is so HOT!!!!! i cant wait tell the 4th one comes out!!!</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wowwww... I didn't realize that I was so good in the movie. Thanks!</p><hr><p><b>Mandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Worst movie out of the entire series. I felt like it was rushed during the short hours and no to mention some of the actors/actresses didn't fit to their role</p><hr><p><b>rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>brill i know all the spells and the words but i read it anyway</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Mandy</p><hr><p><b>ordph</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Mandy, too. I'm a great fan of HP and IMO it was the worst movie of the series. I prefer CoS. It seems GoF will be better</p><hr><p><b>Rosie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Daniel Racliffe is mine i think he gorge and lush!</p><hr><p><b>Abigail M</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I may have to disgree with Mandy. I think PoA was the best out of the series. It had great style. The problem was the plot. It didn't follow the book too well.</p><hr><p><b>brin</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Loved it!</p><hr><p><b>rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>cool!!</p><hr><p><b>Maria Luisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>it was a pretty good movie in all, not best of three, but IMO the main point is  The-Maureders-Story-thing they dared to shoot... it was my all-series favourite part!</p><hr><p><b>emma ann</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>that movie was great and Harry potter is as cute as ever</p><hr><p><b>Harry Potter Lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>
   I loved it SO much!  The movie is the best!  I cannot wait for the 4th movie! Only 5 more days!  I LOVE HARRY POTTER!</p><hr><p><b>kathleen</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>hmmz...is this script supposed to be word for word the movie?..coz it's not exactly correct, but newayz..i love anything hp</p><hr><p><b>wezildpad</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie, so much better then the first 2 movies
and the trio is grown up and they all act so good and I love Emma Watson!!! ^^</p><hr><p><b>Marlene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What a fantastic effort for IMSDb to make PoA's script available to us readers!  Thank you very much!  Now I'm going to look for Chamber of Secrets and Sourcerer's Stone's scripts!  It's really fun to read along with the movie and to notice the omissions and changes!  Please keep up the great work!</p><hr><p><b>Candice</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely wonderful! This is probably my favorite. And Dan looks so hot in this one. It's great to see how much they have grown up! Thanks for dedicating time to have the scripts available for the movies!</p><hr><p><b>Ella Lawton</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film that I have ever watched but the book is better.</p><hr><p><b>Landon</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Once again, I must say, it's really bad that they have a "good" witch craft and a "bad" witch craft.

Yes, witch craft IS real, and it's a sin, but there is no good in it.</p><hr><p><b>Max</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The movie was one of the best I have ever seen but I liked the book more because it had more details in it.</p><hr><p><b>Soon2BActress</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I agree with mandy it was sort of rushed by I still love it but I feel the others were better.</p><hr><p><b>hotty hot hotty</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Loved it very much.</p><hr><p><b>Georgina m</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was great, I love hermione.</p><hr><p><b>Taria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Harry Potter's the best thing in the world. Well let's make that best book in the world. I wish I could go to Hogwarts, it sounds brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It was the greatest movie so far. It was better than the first and second but I think Steven Kloves can do better for the fourth.</p><hr><p><b>Harry Potter is a hottie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am a major fan of Daniel Radcliffe / Harry Potter! I have read all of the 
Harry Potter series and think the 1-4 movies were not that good compared to the books. But Daniel plays the role so perfectly.</p><hr><p><b>Nyx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow, this script was wicked! I wish this was more what the movie was like. The characterization was so much better! So many scenes would've been better this original way, even if they were slightly cut, rather than the way they were reworded in the actual film. Not saying anything against the film, I personally loved it, but this would have been WOW!
</p><hr><p><b>mrs. potter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mandy stinks, the movie was not rushed I think it was awesome. Hermione rocks, Dan Radcliffe is the hottest english actor in the entire world. We are so going to be married one day. We are going to open up our own Quidditch shop in Diagon Alley.</p><hr><p><b>Dylan Rhoney</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed POA but it didn't have the same feeling as the other two. I felt the same about the book. But it was enjoyable.</p><hr><p><b>HPFA</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent.</p><hr><p><b>Formidable Human Being</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It would be better if the whole draft would be included in the film, they had cut some smaller dialogues and some important scenes (Sir Cadogan, halloween, Sirius Black in the Gryffindor dormitory). But the script did have these things and I was quite satisfied. 7 stars because they had cut out a lot of Quidditch and the finale was not good at all. The film was really lyrical and impressive till Hogsmeade visited in Christmas, everything was pretty good. But after the Patronus lesson with Lupin, too many things were cut. I think that the script didn't show the internal emotions of Harry's adolescence but commiting them in purpose of showing too many "catchy" scenes for commercial success. At least, it did have many things that could raise Potter to a new level of the filming industry.</p><hr><p><b>human being</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Parv, nice movie it couldn't get much better. But I really wonder why always in Harry Potter movies the defence against the dark arts teachers are close to bad guys. Like in HP first Professor Snape was SHOWN like he wants to kill Harry. In the 2nd Lockhart tried to vanish Harry's memory. In the 3rd Lupin was a werewolf. In the 4th although not the real one but Moody was trying to kill Harry in the last scene of moody and Harry and made him survive all the tasks so that he could reach the portkey and lead him to Voldemort. It's such a mystery, I like mysteries at least there is someone to suspect during the movie. And yes I forgot Prisoner of Azkaban was great.</p><hr><p><b>Prongsette</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great Film, loved it all. Except the HUGE MISTAKES with Sirius and Remus. 
Sirius was WAY too crazy and not at all like I pictured him, I mean what was with the tatoos? Remus on the other hand was too skiny and acted like Lily was his best friend, WHICH SHE wasn't! Also his werewolf was stupid, there was no fur or tail. Which equalls stupid! My friend also pointed out that his moustache was ridiculous.</p><hr><p><b>emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh that was just so awesome! And if Daniel Radcliff is reading this then, hi Dan! I hope to be seeing you in the 5th movie soon! The 4th was so great. It's my 4th time reading the Harry Potter books. Ha ha Dan'll probally never read this.</p><hr><p><b>sophia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Good movie, good script!</p><hr><p><b>Bhakti</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The movie could have beenbetter but it was still great. I don't think the new dumbledor acts good. I like the old directors better. The 1st and 2nd movie were better. The 4th movie is rushed!</p><hr><p><b>Amber</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Harry Potter books! Last night I watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.</p><hr><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I liked the movie. It was great. My only problem was the shrunken head in the knight bus. What was that anyway? I miss Richard Harris!</p><hr><p><b>Voldy's Angel</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This movie was absolutely horrible. Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite book, and I think that Emma Watson had way too many lines in this movie. Ron barely talks. The humour and CGI was great, but I still think this is the worst movie made in the Harry Potter series.</p><hr></td>
