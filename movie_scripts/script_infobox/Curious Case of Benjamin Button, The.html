  <tr>
    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Savannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Pretty well put together. The movie didn't focus on anything in particular, but just simply about Benjamin Button along with the curiosity of death. </p><hr><p><b>Dan Haugh</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>In a word.. SLOW! In two words.. TOO SLOW! But, having said that, it was riveting because the viewer was waiting to find out the secret, the answer.
Problem is, nearly three hours later and now the next day, I am still wondering if I got the answer I was waiting for. It had a bit of "underdog overcomes diversity", but in the end I am not sure who the winner is.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The movie was really long and tediously boring.  Other than the fact that Benjamin Button ages backwards, there was nothing compelling about this movie.  

This type of story was meant to be read in a novel, where you can really get inside the characters heads and understand what they are going through.  Film is a visual medium and this movie failed to make the best use of movement and tempo, although the cinematography was good.  

There was little conflict, less tension and almost no suspense (except for ONE scene.)  Benjamin had no real goal, and there was no tangible antagonist. Also, this movie failed to illicit any genuine emotion, other than mere curiosity.

This is a definite rental, where you can fall asleep in the comfort of your own home. </p><hr><p><b>Alyson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What do you mean it didn't focus on anything in particular? It is a story about life and love, not the curiosity of death. Death is an inevitable part of life. This is not a tale of death, it is about being alive under unusual circumstances. He happened to be living his life backward but still understood just as little as the rest of us. It is an amazing story and an absolutely gorgeous film. </p><hr><p><b>Link</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I knew it when I saw the movie that the script makes you feel like whne you see the movie.
And it does, this is way to great for a rating of ten, I five 1000 points, but that's just me, some people (Don't know why) just hate movies like this one 'cause they don't have explosions, shoting or crude humnor or even sex. Waht the heel does that have to do with movies?

There 3 kind of movies: Those made to entertain, like Transformers. Those made as art, like The Diving Bell And The Butterfly. And there are few movies that reach the status of a movie made for art as well for entertainment, like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, or even The Dark Knight.

I sure hope this comment reaches the eyes of readers or people like me. Movies are just great, wahtever the way your pint of view, religion, country, movies are for expanding your thoughts of the events that happened, or are happening. Ijust hope the people can change for a positive mood, and I'm sure movies are a way to positive change.
</p><hr><p><b>E-Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Many of my friends thought this film was too long and drawn out.  I felt that the film could have been longer, and I would have still loved it.  The art direction and the scenery of the film amazed me.  There was wonderful acting by all in the film, especially Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  The screenplay was poignant and incited thought about the fragility of life and the transience of moments.  Overall, the film was great.</p><hr><p><b>Enzi</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The extraordinary journey of Benjamin Button who was born with the debilitating handicaps of an old man. We follow his challenging life from an ugly unwanted child to a young boy in an old man's body. As he seeks to understand and participate in life, he grows taller and younger while everyone around him grows older. Life and death issues come and go and come again. </p><hr><p><b>Jane</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film might be slow but it shows you even though you're getting younger day by day, death is irreversible.</p><hr><p><b>Inga</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Benjamin Button is probably the best movie to have been released in recent times. While it is a compelling story about an unfortunately timed love, it is crafted into a tremendous cinematographic nutshell of the tragedy of death and the hardship of life. Life, however sultry it may be, is bitterly sweet when it comes to facing our own deficits while our mind is still ripe, and much awake. F. Scott Fitzgerald is timeless. No one will ever reproduce his work as masterly as he has created it. This film is a genuinely close second. Hollywood isn't a scam here. If you're both deep and smart enough, go ahead and purchase the DVD, because if you rent it, you will keep wanting to see it over and over again.</p><hr><p><b>Gravas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Not because the story that in spite of been interesting, follow the usual line of the Americans blockbusters, not because de art direction that is amazing, using the sepia to lead us to the American south of the early 20th century. Not because the narrative that reminded me the already unforgettable Forrest Gump. Not because the discussion of life and death or that analogy of an old woman taking care of her beloved husband till the end of his days doesn’t matter if he is an old man or a baby child. The final motivation is the same. But because the marvelous and spectacular level of acting play reached by this guy that is recognized around the world since 1992 by the name of Brad Pitt. From a very small and unimportant role in a totally forgettable Thelma & Louise – till the very best current actor in a world in these days and generation. What a trajectory! Yet we take off the flop Troy and the Ocean’s Eleven franchising (where he acted himself without any work) what remains are caracters so much sculptured in hands in what are lessons on how to turn simple written words in truly art masterpieces. From the superficial label of Sex Symbol, successfully running out of the plastic kind of productions that marked the entire Tom Cruise’s career, to thousands of profiles and situations when he unfold himself in many different kind of people without leaving any clue from one to another. If you put in comparison his performance as Jesse James and Benjamin Button (to stay in the most recent works)… Is like to place front to front 2 mankind so diverse as Hitler and Chaplin (And the funny story is that Pitt could act the both of them without you could say that is same actor). And the Academy follows in debt with this monster of the acting play. Not discussing the historic greatness of a Sean Penn, but is a very long time by now that Pitt have been deserved a best Academy evaluation. If you watch the "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"… You’ll see that that hard and rocked creature don't leave a tiny clue of the sweet and life passionate Benjamin Button. And what is worst or better… Not even of Brad Pitt himself. Following this man's career is a privilege!</p><hr><p><b>Tim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this was a great film and script. Unlike the one textbook critique above.  What it lacks in terms of formulative script writing it  redeems with the overall theme of life and the mysteries of time.  It's genuine.  It's not rife with the audio and visual din of CGI that normally appeals to the status quo.  There in lies just one aspect of it's beauty, its appeal.  I really enjoyed that it resonated the lyrical poetry and insight of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Simply put, it deserved to win more Oscars.</p><hr><p><b>Deven</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Benjamin button is purely a beautiful cast and a perfect script coming together at one time to make a movie that nothers could make, Brad was excellent and so was his charchter, this is my all time favorite movie, and I am not even a fan of movies like this." somethings never last".</p><hr><p><b>ryme</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I thought the movie was interesting as well as disturbing in a way. Also, All these high ratings and big egos, such as the "critic" above, have nothing to provide but a perception of the movie so there is no true right or wrong opinion. P. S. Brad Pitt was kind of off in this movie, but it showed he can play any part.</p><hr><p><b>maphia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A counter-clockwise life. The virtue is you are getting younger while everyone around you getting old. Therefore the inevitable sufferings are you are witness your beloved ones die in succession. That's the anguish ben suffers. Anyway, a good "scar movie", in which we are moved by the truth of whether there is eternality or not, but the unyielding belief in the possibility of an eternal love and life.</p><hr><p><b>vandana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It would have been wonderful if our lives are similar, from old growing young and a peaceful death. I love if that happens to me. I can just feel the movie.</p><hr><p><b>jane</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script itself has great flair and wit, the writer (perhaps inspired by his sourse material) imbuing it with a wonderfully 'literary' quality.</p><hr><p><b>CJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I cried my heart out. They loved each other to the very end. It was as beautiful as it could get. And can I just say something? Brad was HOT in this movie. Only when he wasn't old of course.</p><hr><p><b>emileyrose</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Benjamin button was a very slow long film but in all fairness it was amazing I thought personally it was a very touchy and heart warming film at the end I saw it as sad and emotional to even tell the truth I even had tears who ever made this is imaged real life situations and this is possibly true also my dad loves this film its a film you can never forget I absolutely LOVE it it is fab.</p><hr><p><b>Max Krantx Sweden</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen this movie 2-3 times. And I'm still crying every time. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Oh damn please I need a hug.</p><hr><p><b>mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I understand why people say it is too long and I would admit that some of the story could be taken out and it really wouldn't change the overall movie, but it still, I think, is one of the greatest movies ever. The story is so unique, especially in a time when Hollywood would rather make a remake than put out something original. A beautiful and sad story.</p><hr><p><b>Mars</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>The problem is not the length, but rather the two protagonists constantly meeting along the journey takes away from the magic of them "catching up." Fincher's swing at the romance genre is welcome, but the result was his most disappointing. Yet, like all of his work, it seems to go completely unchallenged and all dissenting opinions of its greatness are always dismissed.</p><hr><p><b>Paula</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A life, love, death lived in reverse. Appreciation for the little things. So moving and visual. Hummingbirds are amazing little creatures.</p><hr></td>
