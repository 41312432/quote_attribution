In short, the jazz expert, which Vincent the assasin quized on jazz for his life, got it wrong.  Dead wrong.  </p><hr><p><b>Max</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Good movie. Tom Cruise played the part well. The ending was a bit of a let down though, but then I guess if they ended it just like a normal action movie it would've ruined it...</p><hr><p><b>peter schuster</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>loved it. Cruise and Foxx were great. The best part was the ending. Great Job.</p><hr><p><b>Zach Murray</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Michael Mann makes another great movie. Great cinematography, how LA should be portrayed, Cruise and Foxx both shine.</p><hr><p><b>Nima</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Tom cruise did great in this film.</p><hr><p><b>Dr. Gonzo</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I really loved this film. Max, you're crazy the ending was beautiful.</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie, great acting, great ending, </p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Love Mann. Cruise has never been an actor and in this "performance" is no good. Mann is a genious filmaker and he may be the most underrated director in cinema. I will never understand the need for Tom to be used in this role. I guess that oscar award must mean life or death for an actor so they get desparate, and perhaps they told Mann that if he did not use Cruise he can't make the movie. I hate Cruise, why is he in my world. Tom Cruise is the least scariest person on the planet. Shame on you Cruise for having the blind ego you probably deserve to have, please pull your self together and stick to your Mission Impossible movies! Dont worry Tom, you will get your lifetime achievemnt oscar and then you can finlaly be happy. This film was an insult to every good actor who plays a villiain in the history of film.</p><hr><p><b>coll</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie is very good, the actors too. The music was perfect. No movie has entertained me as much since Carpenter's "The Thing" and "The Green Line".</p><hr><p><b>Tom</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie I have ever seen. The ending? Beautiful.</p><hr><p><b>Larry</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Great picture. It's not another meat head action movie there's real acting going on. Mann, Cruise and Foxx make this something to remember.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Jesse, I get what you're saying about Tom Cruise not being a natural first choice when casting a villain. But I thought he was quite sinister in this. His character had all of the ingredients that a good villain should have - he was a sociopath, impossible for other characters to like, but with just enough charm, eloquence and humour (the scene on the radio with Jamie Foxx's boss) to make him likeable to the audience. There were complexities to Cruise's character that went far beyond your typical moustachioed bad guy and I thought his demise at the end would have been heart-breaking, were he not such a total bastard.   
I loved the way this movie was shot, it looked as though it had been hand-coloured by Zen artists with bruise-coloured skies and sepia tinted frames. Not a perfect movie by any stretch but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  </p><hr><p><b>ashley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant film. Tom Cruise done well as usual. Good ending.</p><hr><p><b>ash</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It may be the best film whose events happened in the streets, the same intensity is easily found in HEAT of Michael Mann. I find it perfect. Tom Cruise was extraordinary.</p><hr><p><b>james</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A perfectly 'cool' movie. Even enjoyed tom cruise in it. Genius film by Michael Mann.</p><hr><p><b>Alicia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie takes an artistic and realistic approach, it speaks volumes about how two very different people can come to see the world in each others eyes. The message is clear and powerful and the images haunting. The acting in this movie was amazing Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise were great together. Michael Mann is a genius!</p><hr><p><b>Brett</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this film from the beginning to the end. Definately the best film I have watched so far. Everything about the film was perfectly matched. The music, the setting, the acting, the story-line, the filming style. It all matches perfectly, like any good film. Very impressed. Good job Michael Mann!</p><hr><p><b>Niels</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Screwd script, written with such panaché and understatement that reading it, is like devouring a tender steak.
Innovative and profound, the script reads like a novel. </p><hr><p><b>Loki</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jesse- you are completely out of touch with reality. For whatever reason you hate him- you allowed that hatred to form a completely biased view of a great film. Your comments are completely off base and no honest criticism in anything you said. How can someone you don't even personally know, nor who has done anything wrong to you, engender such hatred in you. It would seem you are more of a sociopath than the character played by Cruise in the movie. Seek some serious help dude or girl- whatever the case may be. By the way- if you hate him so much- why in the world did you watch the movie in the first place?</p><hr><p><b>Benji</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely sensational film, Mann captures the essence of night and the vast wilderness of being alone in a dog eat dog world. Superb! I could seriously watch this film without any dialogue and just listen to the music and watch the cab roam the streets for eternity, the score and the locations are brilliantly shot, Mann just knows how to illustrate a mood and the chemistry between Foxx and Cruise just worked on so many levels, the fact that you feel Foxx isn't even scared of Cruise by the end, he's just sorry for him and that unintentional closeness they develop during the night club scene. Brilliant, brilliant film from start to finish.</p><hr><p><b>Dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent script, very professional. The ending was set up with the initial dialog in the cab. Some people don't pay attention to conversational details they consider "filler", however, in this script every word or setup is there for a reason. That is why Collateral is that rare kind of movie you'll enjoy even more the second time you watch it.</p><hr><p><b>Gary </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Superb visuals, the most ingenious plot twists an outstanding score. Tom Cruise was perfect for this role, his work begs the question who is Vincent? My guess is that Vincent was a cop moonlighting as a hitman. Why who else wears white sox with black shoes. And when you think about his catch phrase (Max I do this for a living) it expresses the sarcasm many police officers express when they think they're amongst friends. And don't we all. Every living thing consumes another living thing for a living.</p><hr><p><b>Joe</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Anyone know why the writer changed the screenplay from Louis Armstrong to Miles Davis (in the jazz club scene)? ALSO. Why didn't Cruise kill the the in the beginning of the movie-- when it's apparent he's at the federal building?</p><hr><p><b>gj boxy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tom is a good actor, a real screen presence, not De Niro, but even his ego can handle that, and, in this great, dark, beautifully scripted movie Tom does shine, he is a star and the roll of Vincent is played well by Tom, animalistic, driven by his hunger for success, a sociopath, a killer sociopath, an animal in human form, for only such a human feeds on it's own for a living. Tom is perfect for this part, almost not acting, this is his script, written all over his lion like face, a beast man, running down the night road, starving for prey, in flight from the L. A. Zoo, he'll rip anyone or anything apart to get back to his chained existence in a fake jungle home, and Jamie the Fox did a hell of a good job staying beside him and not dying. All else was a blur of peripherals because that's the way the show was written, focused script, focused audience, professional stuff, a clean kill Mann. Just a final word from the really great and wonderful Mr Miles Davis, on music, movies, life and everything ."Know your show, and don't lose the plot baby.".</p><hr><p><b>3TH</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tom Cruise was exceptional in this one! Don't know what they're talking about. If you didn't like him in "Magnolia" or "Born on 4th of July" I can at least understand. He did "movie star" kind of acting there. With all his yelling and going nuts. But in this one? He's subtle and just gorgeous. Expressing complicated emotions with slightest tone or gesture. That guy's god.</p><hr><p><b>Nicky Haugh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>While I could praise Michael Mann for creating yet another film that is simply "just perfect", Collateral is actually so much more than just an masterful thriller. For his role as Vincent, arguably my favourite film antagonist of all-time, Tom Cruise portrayed a characteristic hitman who is purely indifferent and is beyond both good and evil. In saying that, Vincent is a ruthless and manipulative sociopath who merely disregards human life because of his own description towards everyone else around him. Unlike most characters whom I favour with ambition and motivation, Vincent is one of those characters who develops no interest towards any futuristic goals and is only engaging in his commitment because in his words "It's what I do". For me, it's because "it's the only thing I do because it's what I'm good at doing". In short, the film is pure perfection through the interaction and differences between Tom Cruise's Vincent and Jamie Foxx's Max for their own personal viewpoints towards life and the meaning of purpose. Like I said, perfect.</p><hr></td>
