    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Jess</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think that final destination was brill! I think that it could have had more blood and gore but apart from that it was brilliant! Also the lead Alex was pretty fit as well! But the movie had a good plot and a good ending! I'm glad they changed the ending because if it was like they had originally planned then it would have ruined the movie! I'm glad that Alex didn't die.</p><hr><p><b>meghan</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Original  would have been much better, would have given the movie some depth and redemptive potential. The produced verson's ending just reduced it to the normal Hollywood crap it uses to manipulate audiences.</p><hr><p><b>ken</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love FD, I think it's the best horror series. FD 1 was great, FD 2 was great and so was FD 3. All great and scary!</p><hr><p><b>Arkaela</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like all of the FDs but to me Final Destination 3 is better than the other 2. Why? Because they use pictures to tell how they'll die and the ending shocked me because everyone died on the train crash.</p><hr><p><b>jennie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>FD1 was awesome plus Sean William Scott was so fit! The second was probably the funniest and the third had the most blood and gore in it. So they all rock! :)</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think all the final destination movies are awesome. I personally think the 3rd one was the best. I'm into movies that freak me out and final destination 3 sure did its job.</p><hr><p><b>liam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think all of the Final Destination movies are awesome, but I personally think the second film was the best out of all three. I hope more are made!</p><hr><p><b>Alberto</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Final Destination 3 is the scariest movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>wendy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really enjoy Final Destination 3 the most because it has bonus features, and it has a choose their fate mode where you can change the movie a bit. I hope I'm not ruining the whole movie for all those that wish to watch this, my fave characters in the movie are Wendy and Kevin, I really think that Jason guy is hot! I really hope they make at least three more movies.</p><hr><p><b>Scream Fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This script was good but I like the movie better. And Ken this is not the best series, Scream is. But hey that is your opinion.</p><hr><p><b>Melissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved them all. They were all great but I have to say I liked FD3 the best. I was wondering if anyone has the script for it.</p><hr><p><b>ANA</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie on earth bitches!</p><hr><p><b>Catherine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever! It rocks and if you haven't seen it, where have you been all this time? Kris Lemche is a god.</p><hr><p><b>Amber</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Can somebody put up the Final Destination 3 script? I'd be forever grateful. Thanks!</p><hr><p><b>Ciara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that Jason was totally hot and he was so sweet. I cried when he died.</p><hr><p><b>Tiffany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the first movie to send shivers up my spine, to make me think 'Can that really happen?'. For that, I rate it the best.</p><hr><p><b>Jason</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This guy has my name, it was sad he fell to his death and the DUMB ASS rollercoaster people wouldn't let him and that girl off. In the pictures jason is doing the devil's pose but behind him is the rollercoaster car. There's two clues 1) It looks like the first thee cars are going off the tracks like it did in the vision and it happened. 2) It looks like it going to hit his head. Ohhh painful death.</p><hr><p><b>Jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I've only seen the first two Final Destination movies, but I thought they were both spectacular. Sure, they creeped me out to no end, but the stories were awesome. I especially loved the ripple effect they used in the second movie in response to the first. Eight out of ten because I'm yet to see the third.</p><hr><p><b>Rigdon</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I like all the FDs but FD3 is the best. I was so depressed that Kevin died.</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen all 3 of the FD movies and I'd have to say that the first is my favorite and the best, in my opinion. To me, that one seemed more shocking than the other two. This one scared me the most. I also liked the lead, Alex, of course, we have the same name! Anyway I thought Devon Sawa was awesome. With the second one, I really liked the whole concept of the events of the first film having a ripple effect on others. The 3rd movie was definitely the bloodiest, but I did like some the deaths. I think the Final Destination movies are underrated, they are so awesome! But right now, I still think that the 1st one is THE BEST. I hope they do make a 4th one.</p><hr><p><b>Peyton</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the Final Destination series. I can't wait till they make the 4th movie in 2009. That's what I heard. Kris Lemche is mine gals, so back off!</p><hr><p><b>Raven</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love all the Final Destination movies. I think the concept of them was so great and the third one is definitely my favorite (mostly because of Kris Lemche but I also like the whole picture idea and the fact that it was a roller coaster that they died on). The first one was great too. I didn't love the second as much, but it was still good. Can't wait for the fourth one.</p><hr><p><b>Joshua</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am a huge fan of FD series. I haven't watched this one yet so thanks
IMSDb for the script! (Although I know the ending was different).</p><hr><p><b>Natasha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The FD series are good, but they're my worst fear because those are things that could actually happen in real life.</p><hr><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The 1st and 3rd were my favourites, number 2 not so much. One thing I don't understand in the first FD movie is how Alex survived the live wire shock. Can anyone explain that to me?</p><hr><p><b>CerebralZombie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing movie, and too bad it wasn't as well done as the script. Still, one of the best horror movies of its time.</p><hr><p><b>jachana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love final destination and they should keep making movies out of it.</p><hr><p><b>Draco</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Classic man, love the way the characters die. It's how someone might die in real life. I'd have to say the first one's still the best.</p><hr><p><b>Ann</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is a shooting script that almost reads like a screenplay, though the shooting directions are sometimes invasive. But vocabulary, description is crisp, excellent. It's like watching the film while reading. Excellent film for its genre. A real rarity.</p><hr></td>
