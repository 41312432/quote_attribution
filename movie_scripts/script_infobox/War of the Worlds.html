Hollywood screenplays that get made into movies really have script editors this crappy?</p><hr><p><b>Eliza</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely love the movie, but I have to agree with Luke. The grammar in this is much worse than in most of the other scripts I've read. It must not be the shooting script, because a lot of the wording is different. I'm assuming this is a first or second draft screenplay.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Most of the time it made no sense but still entertaining and powerful at times.</p><hr><p><b>Tally</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie so much. They should make a chat room about this!</p><hr><p><b>Coty Thompson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Good job Tyler.</p><hr><p><b>joshua</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Storyline: terrible (didn't the son die?). Acting: good job by Dakota, terrible job by Cruise. Special effects: it's a Speilberg film, he is going to spend millions on effects to cover up the fact that it was a terrible film.</p><hr><p><b>Chaz</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>You guys have got to be kidding me. This screenplay was so bad I couldn't even finish the film! Mr Friedman - you may have an interesting blog but perhaps you should have let David do this one alone. Hollywood you are horrific with a capital 'H'!</p><hr><p><b>Jacobo</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This film is the worst adaptation of a good novel. It is a copy of the War of the world 1956. Please read the H.G.Wells' novel.</p><hr><p><b>Marco</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The action sequences were okay, but the story was horrible.  After aliens squash everybody, the family comes out untouched and smiling.  Too bad no major character died.</p><hr><p><b>Evey</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Joshua: No, the son did not die.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The science fiction idea was pretty good and I like how Tom Cruise played Ray in this movie.</p><hr><p><b>kk</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie made my eyes water because I didn't blink once, in the scene where he's yelling at the guys to get off of the car I just want to jump up and scream "GET OFF" Ooooohhhh. I love it very much. I even made a chain for 66 days in advance just waiting for it to come out on dvd Nov 22 (great day).</p><hr><p><b>Bobby</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw it in the theater 6 times! My mom made me stop going, but one night I snuck out and saw it with my friends again. I draw pictures of it all the time! And I daydreamed during school all day! Myfriends laugh at me because I have 3 on dvd and 1 on vhs. This is the best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Saumil Aher</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Inspiration, it's not about the story as conventionally Sci-fi always has to come up with something extra-ordinary, but the perspective, the visual glaze over the story. Wonderful SFX that bridge really got my adrenaline rush going. Some days I really fear when human need to fight for their existence. May it sustain only in movies.</p><hr><p><b>Ben</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Totally awesome. All I can say is that it was the best alien invasion movie ever made. And also, Bobby, what if I told you it was never released on VHS?</p><hr><p><b>Hundert</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A short question. I don't get how those alien machines stopped? Suddenly their protection shields turn off or something and become vulnerable to arms.</p><hr><p><b>Vin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Bacteria killed them off very slowly, it was something they didn't know or got rid off and forgot on their own planet. Very strong ending, H.G. Wells was a genius.</p><hr><p><b>kelsey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think it was brilliant, especially the realistic weather. The introduction was the best.</p><hr><p><b>Paul</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A movie for those who appreciate both explosions and subtlety. It is an allegory for our own modern day conflicts. For those complaining about the grammar etc, this is obviously a transcript, not a script. The tripods would not be referred to as "robots" by the writers. I'd love to see a real shooting script with the deleted scenes as opposed to valiant efforts like this.</p><hr><p><b>Jimmy</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Best alien invasion movie in the last 30 years. Steven Spielberg at his best. Loved all of it.</p><hr><p><b>jenneifer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film, I'm obsessed. I really want to be in a film like this. I wish I was dakota fanning because this is my ideal film.</p><hr><p><b>Doc Block</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>So many plot holes. They raped the original idea and turned it into a father and son film. You think aliens who have the technology and resources to fly machines through the galaxy to Earth- bury them and then decide after a few millions years to come back and invade, would have just invaded the first time round. Plus why wait until there's humans on Earth? Why not just take the planet when they first sent the machines?- this film has so many plot holes its probably one of Spielberg's biggest crimes. He has the power, influence, budget and the skill to have made this the greatest epic alien invasion film ever, and what does he do- he turns it into a fluffy love story between a deadbeat father and his family (who all amazingly survive an alien invasion). At least Independence Day made sense plot wise and was more exciting to watch even if it was cheesy and suffered from the whole "america saves the world" syndrome. I was so disappointed by this film I felt like writing an abusive email to Paramount, Dreamworks and Spielberg himself. The only plus I give this film is that the imagery is very powerful, and the SPFX are top class as usual. If the plot matched it could have been a great film. Think 3 hour epic invasion film YEAH.</p><hr><p><b>shwan shilani</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best alien invasion movies. I loved the action, the storyline. I hope there will be another movie like this in the future.</p><hr><p><b>Dravin</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I did like the plot and setting but it could've been better. Didn't like the father and son/daughter crisis in this movie. When mankind is attacked then there is no time for a family dispute. Trust me when I say this (not that I'm a pessimist): when an alien army is going to attack us and if they would be far more superior than us, we wouldn't stand a chance to fight them back. Aliens would use something like a planet killer to wipe us out in a mere second. They wouldn't bother to wage a war consuming precious time of theirs. But anyway, it was a good movie and I enjoyed it. Hope that all of you did the same.</p><hr><p><b>J</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm a huge Cruise/Spielberg fan. I was an extra in the film and it was one of the best times I ever had. Hands down one of the best invasion films ever made. The story hits me because it's about a normal guy and his kids having to deal with the worst case scenario.</p><hr><p><b>Burt</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I saw the movie, and as some people here say, it made me cry. Yes it did that to me also, for the $10.00 I wasted on it. Cruise was his usual horrible-egotistic self, and the screaming girl, (Dakota, Spielberg has a thing about kids) I was praying that the aliens kill her off in the beginning of the movie.  This is a very bad re-make of the 1953 version, which was good. It totally ruined the story for me. The graphics were the only thing good in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Ryan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Just amazing. Forget the polt holes, just sit back and enjoy this movie. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Whether the plot made sense or not it was genious, very deep, at least to me. I hope another comes out! The only thing is the language. You can get the point accross without so much cursing.</p><hr><p><b>bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>It's funny they said that all electrical devices didn't work around the crash site yet the cameras that the news team used work?</p><hr><p><b>steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>One of the worst movies ever made. It's not a movie about a war between worlds--it's a movie about a dysfunctional family. Full of plot holes and worthless padding. When the 1953 version blows this one away, you know you have a total bomb.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Absolute trash. Poor version, poor acting. This is not a film about a family. You will get a much better story if you took the family out of it and concentrated it all on the actions of people and the destruction. And why was Ogilvy a merger of 3 original characters? It was a dreadful piece. There was so much good stuff from the original story left out. Worst Version Ever.</p><hr></td>
