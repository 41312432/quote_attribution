It has everthing, Comedy, Action, Romance, and the characters even have sub-stories of their own. Very, VERY, well done movie. 

Oh, AND GOOD MUSIC! I just recently bought the Critirion Collection version of the movie and the Original score soundtrack.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent action, excellent actor crew, excellent director, music etc.!!!</p><hr><p><b>Billy</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>The message is very clear : the Americans save the world, they're the greatest heroes. 
Deafening din, rows, screams from start to end. The movie I hate the most.</p><hr><p><b>Nim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my all time favourite film. I totally agree with Armageddon fan </p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>If Pearl Harbour is a three-hour Right Guard commercial, then this is a three-hour commercial for Tommy Hilfiger, with the United Colours of Benetton thrown in for scenes involving foreigners. 

There’s also a hint of Old Spice and a dash of Blue Stratos, which would be appropriate because it stank! 

Appalling is too generous a word to describe this steaming turd of a movie. But I did love the part where Bruce Willis tells “the most intelligent man in the world,” to shut his hole, or words to that effect. And the part where the NASA test pilots stand, arms folded, as if waiting for the school photographer to show up, for about five minutes of screen time. 
All the flag fluttering, slow walks across the launch pad and pro-US, xenophobic rubbish didn’t even boil my piss as it usually does…I must be mellowing in my old age. Either that or I was distracted by a new kind of crap that I hadn’t seen before. 
At the cinema I saw this in, a middle-aged woman actually punched the air at the moment the asteroid exploded…huh huh huh! That for me was the most entertainment I’d had all afternoon. 

 
</p><hr><p><b>cathy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow the best film goin the only one that can make me cry it is my all time fav film it's fab.</p><hr><p><b>Nicola</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my all time favorite film, I love it, I love all sci-fi films but I like this one the most, it made me cry!</p><hr><p><b>just a fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was so far the best movie I've seen, hot characters and also great characters. It makes the movie awesome. Not only the actors but the effects and the script were fantastic. It made me cry so much, it's everything people should be!</p><hr><p><b>Josh</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It's not nearly the best movie, but it was definitely fun to watch once.</p><hr><p><b>ash</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree I don't know what's wrong with everyone out there. Armageddon has got to be one of the best movies made and you sad gronks out there have nothing better to do than criticise a perfectly great movie. It has the lot. Eye candy, action, comedy, crying EVERYTHING. I know this movie back to front so don't diss it.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Hey Ash, each to their own mate. But, in the interests of film appreciation, let's look at the credentials of this one: 1) Was it plausible? No. 2) Was it exciting? No. 3) Were the characters well drawn, with enough depth that you perhaps wondered what they might be doing immediately after the events of the film........No! 4) Did the film maker give an accurate portrayal of the world and all of its rich and diverse cultures? No! 5) Was it romantic? No. 6) Was it well scripted? No. 7) Was there dramatic gravity in the weightlessness of space?  No. 
8) Did it raise a laugh? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. Not even a chortle or a momentary titter! Sorry pal, each to their own, like I said.</p><hr><p><b>Austin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is absolutely perfect. I have watched it every day for like 3 weeks now.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Limey, I don't see how you can hate this movie so much. It's not that bad, is it?</p><hr><p><b>Greg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  The acting was fantastic, the script was incredible, every character had a backstory and they were all believeable.  They did a great job by showing them on the drill, training for the flight, and actually on the asteroid.  You got to know the characters and actually cared what happened to them.  Fantastic all-around movie</p><hr><p><b>Rob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best films I've ever seen, I love Bruce Willis!</p><hr><p><b>Dave C</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Limey's a little disturbed, seeing that no film on the planet has the qualities he's looking for. All that aside, the film isn't the best ever but the basic idea and special effects were good enough to keep me interested. It's a film I can watch more than once without putting daggers in my eyes.</p><hr><p><b>brent</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much. I can't count how many times I have watched it, I cry every time.</p><hr><p><b>Sandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is just an amazing film. I've seen it so many times, I've lost count. I've never cried while watching but my adrenaline gets pumping every time, plus the ending makes me wanna cheer each time. Absolutely fantastic, memorable classic that the critics tore apart because it was too pro-American. This is a film that will be remembered.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my favorite movies. It has everything. Great action, great story, great special effects, great characters, and it also has a meaningful impact on you.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>"I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep, etc etc". Why ever not?</p><hr><p><b>Patriot</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"I address you tonight, not as the President of the United States, not as a Leader of a Country, but as a citizen of humanity. We are faced with the very gravest of challenges, the bible calls this day Armageddon. The end of all things, and yet for the first time in the history of the Planet, a species has the technology to prevent it's own extinction. All of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service. The human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space all of our combined modern techologies and imaginations, even the wars we fought have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle. Through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrong and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our time. There is one thing that has nursed our souls and elevated our species above its orgins and that is our courage. Dreams! Of an entire Planet are focused tonight on those fourteen brave souls travelling into the heavens and may we all citizens all oversee these events through. Godspeed and good luck to you". - US President.</p><hr><p><b>Film Critics Centre</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies ever made. I didn't give it a 10 because of its fire in space.</p><hr><p><b>Dark Reign</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This is one of those films I watch again and again, I like the story and the effects, as I am studying both. It's a good movie with a good story. I don't see why people dog this film. It's better than lot of the films coming out of Hollywood. Only reason I don't give this a 10 is because of the special effects and another errors I see in it. But for story and script I give it a 10.</p><hr><p><b>Mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Aww how sad! I'm not an emotional person but by god did this touch me! A bloody job well done!</p><hr><p><b>Jay619</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I want to know the 'Captain America' part!</p><hr><p><b>Brent</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Lateral grid nine it's like 15 HQ, Captain America here blew the landing by 26 miles.</p><hr><p><b>lovergurl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, it's my favorite! The song by Aerosmith is my favorite song too, it's mine and my boyfriends. It's one of the things that make this movie wonderful!</p><hr><p><b>Megatron</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Surprised by the love this movie gets. Yeah it's a fun action film but it doesn't stand out from the crowd and it's a trashy as it gets.</p><hr><p><b>MJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! I've already watch this film a lot of times but every time I watch it I cry! It's very touching.</p><hr><p><b>missy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely loved it. I watched I-don't-know-how-many times and I always cried. Acting is fantastic, story, script. Great job everybody! The best film ever!</p><hr><p><b>Aram</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is seriously one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. It has some comedy, action, drama, and love. It keeps you interested the whole way through and it is never boring. I've seen it many times, but every time I watch it I still cry at the end and my eyes are glued to the screen. Acting done by Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler and everyone was amazing. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler really looked like they were in love. Bottom line, it is one of the best movies ever made and should be rated a perfect 10 and all of the actors in this movie should get an academy award. It was the best acting and movie I have ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>Kari</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>My only problem with this film is the way that it makes it seem like earth revolves around America. Come on, people. If the world were about to end, every country on earth would be doing everything in their power to try to destroy that asteroid. America wouldn't be the only ones taking action. That having been said, I do however like this movie, besides that aspect. It has its touching parts that make you smile and its funny parts that make you laugh. Those are always needed to make a good action/thriller film. That and, well of course; lots and lots of well thought out action and intensity. I wouldn't say this movie is brilliant since there are some parts I find hard to believe, but all-in-all, it's a fairly okay film.</p><hr><p><b>lil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watch this movie every night and if I miss a nigh I look up the music on itunes online. I 100% love everything about it and know every word. There are also many mistakes they made in the movie. Like when harry has the golf club he throws it, when he gets mad at AJ , then when he goes to yell at AJ he has the golf club again. There are many more, if you're an Armageddon fanatic like me you would understand and see them. I will become an astronaut and help this planet because of this movie and others too.</p><hr><p><b>Sydney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watch this with my dad every few months .(Love you daddy). It's like our movie. I'm planning to have I Don't want to Miss a Thing (by Aerosmith for you dummies out there) as my father/daughter dance just because we love this movie so much. I've seen it like 30 times and I still cry everytime I see it and liv starts crying. She gives such a genuine performance. Actually all of the actors do. One of my favourite scenes has to be just before the dig crew boards and they all start to sing Leaving on a Jet Plane. Classic horrible voices and all. The characters all have an individual back story that is explored making us care a little bit more about them. They really are rugged characters, not little prissy ones that are upset about going to the prom alone. Love the enthusiasm guys! To all my cousins who are living on the rigs right now. Love you all.</p><hr><p><b>Matthew</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Have any of these people studied film? Limey makes us ASSUME that he has by asking these brilliant questions, however, all his responses were "No" when they were obviously "Yes". Which I thought discredited him. The movie was a great adventure. It was Hollywood at it's finest. We laughed, we cried, we suspended our belief and went on with our lives. This movie isn't going to change the world, but that wasn't what it was for. Limey, it's people like you that make me sick. Get over yourself and get an education.</p><hr><p><b>Jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Honestly this film is terrible. It does nothing but try to make the US look like the only country that can do anything and the poor, cheesy dialogue and acting made me and my family laugh out loud when we watched it. The poor comedy and visual effects were only slightly nullified by Steve Buscemi (Reservoir dogs) and his acting and comedic support. Only Steve Buscemi made this movie bearable, honestly, Bruce Willis shouldn't do emotions because it turned out cheesier and cornier than any movie I've ever seen and Ben Affleck needs to get some acting lessons. Horrible, horrible movie.</p><hr><p><b>John</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Nobody watches this movie to see a cinematic masterpiece displaying some esoteric part of the human element, this was a film that was a phenomenal exhibition of light, shadow, sound, voice inflections, and color. Michael Bay is a master at it.. and this is a clear example. The President's speech where they begin to board the shuttle is amazing, and there is no other word for it. The angles, the light, the flash set, the scene, it was inspiring the first time you saw it. The characters were also built up, appropriately as they were given significance in the film. It was amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>By no means the greatest movie ever, it had its mistakes and flaws as all movies do. However, still one of my alltime favorites. Comedy and action perfectly balanced, in my opinion. Not too much of each. Not so much action you're blown away every second of the movie, not too many horrible corny jokes. I think one of the most underrated and unappreciated jobs of this movie is the role of Dan Truman by Billy Bob Thornton. Great acting and emotion all through the movie. One of his best and most emotional lines is when he yells at Kimsey "This is one order you shouldn't follow and you f***ing know it." Just looking at his face, you can tell he's into the role.</p><hr><p><b>Link</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I really like the movie, not as much as Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen (Go ahead, kill me but I loved it), comedy, action, Michael Bay.
The only complain I have is that it makes the U.S. be the only country capable of saving the world. But other than that, I love it.
Limey, no offense but if you don't like action movies, don't rate them and don't complain about them</p><hr><p><b>dave</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>People stop taking this seriously, Armageddon is big, dumb, stupid move with 1 or 2 plot holes and yet still manages to kick ass. It's kind of like Avatar the storyline is ok but you know you really go to see some cool as visuals and for me steve buscemi. That is all.</p><hr><p><b>Walker</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Non Americans hate the movie because they hate America. America is the only country with the technology and guts to use it in the interest of the world. All the other selfish people would be thinking about their own butts, just like happens now in our world- the world makes us the World Police because no one else will take responsibility. People like Limey epitomize this- ME FIRST! If you act in my interest you must have ulterior motives! The movie itself was a fun, corny, but useless romp.</p><hr><p><b>Mort</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I use Luis Bunuel's criteria for watching any movie; "You have to suspend the critical faculty". I did that when I watched Armageddon and it was bloody brilliant. An Italian friend said "It is so craaaap, Bruce Willis is so craaaap, he cannot act, the film is craaaap, Liv Tyler is made of wood". I told him, "Lorenzo, suspend the critical faculty and it's a rip-roaring action comedy". It can be a handicap to come from the land of Fellini.</p><hr><p><b>cmb</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>This must have been an earlier script?
