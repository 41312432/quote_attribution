    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Matt Gruman</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I read this script after seeing the film. The film itself was awesome and reading the script only makes me want to go see it again! The Wachowskis have hit another goldmine.</p><hr><p><b>Nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the early script. 
The script that is in the movie will probably not be released until the movie comes out on dvd.</p><hr><p><b>Ana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was fantastic, I can't wait until the final script comes out!</p><hr><p><b>Kristy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely amazing.</p><hr><p><b>brittany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>V For Vendetta was amazing. I love when V first appears and he does that long monologue with all of the V words, that's what I want to find. I saw it twice.</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The script seems different to me in some places, like really different.</p><hr><p><b>Laurie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>V was amazing, and his diction is amusing and touching. Great great great movie. I want to see it 7 thousand more times.

The scripts is based more on the comic, I think. Or, it should be because they had to tweak things to make it for a movie. Brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Nicky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I want to know what he says after killing the fingermen. With all of those words that start with V.</p><hr><p><b>anna</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I agree that V's monologues were amazing, and that Natalie Portman's acting was exceptional, but I thought the script they finally decided to go along with was a watered down version of the "subversive" political film they were advertising. The movie is not as morally complex or grey as Portman promotes it, save for her performance it was kind of disappointing.</p><hr><p><b>Jaime</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the film, but this script has different parts to what was in the film like Chris said. I agree with Brittany, V's monologue with all the Vs is amazing - I can't find it in this script though. :(</p><hr><p><b>Pelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was excellent and the pre-script is excellent and in a way they both show the magnificent variation of a great character and a great story. And in both it shows the vengeance of a torn man.

And as always:
"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. "</p><hr><p><b>JORDAN</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wicked.</p><hr><p><b>V</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Fear not people. Order will be restored.</p><hr><p><b>cownar</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow I absolutely loved this film! I've been to see it twice now and I can't wait to see it again and again and again. Well done Wachowskis! I must say that I was not impressed with the matrix, but this  was amazing. V is one of the most intriguing characters I've ever encountered and his monologues were inspiring. A must see!</p><hr><p><b>Chromie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Walking out of the theatre with my friend, all we said was "wow...". There are no words able to properly describe this movie, only that it was amazing. People were even clapping at the end of the movie! It's a definite MUST SEE movie.</p><hr><p><b>Hope</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can someone please tell me what V said? When he said all those damn V words, he lost me at that. The movie was exceptional.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen this movie 3 times between March 17th and March 25th, I must say it was fantastic. This script is not very accruate though and I can't wait til the final copy. Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici.</p><hr><p><b>SJSands</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Being a long time fan of the graphic novels, I was blown away by the movie! The acting was superb, and Weaving in my opinion played V VERY well. It was just... bloody damn good! Even to a Brit like me.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew Untersee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Voila! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished, as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin van-guarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-a-vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.

Think it's correct. GREAT monologue.</p><hr><p><b>Maria Quijada</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It brought me to tears, an exceptional emotional deep and cutting tale. So much life in and below the surface, like a symphony.</p><hr><p><b>JR Gumabon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing amazing movie. Viva La Revolution!</p><hr><p><b>Stormie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That movie was so great! Hey I was wondering if anyone has the monologue with all the v words. I want to use it for my acting class.</p><hr><p><b>Jared</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.</p><hr><p><b>Scooby</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have seen in a long time, V's monologue is amazing. How does he say it all. I've tried it is almost impossible. I loved the army of Vs at the end and felt like I wanted to be in V's revolution. The acting was exquisite and although one did not see V's face one felt as though they knew him. I read some bad reviews from people who read the script and I think anyone who does not like the film is a moron especially when they have not even seen the film. Something out of context can be made to sound stupid by the village idiot let alone an intelligent reviewer (although I feel in this case they are one and the same). You must see, hear and feel it to get a true sense of what is being said.</p><hr><p><b>Sean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent film! The best movie I've seen in ages.</p><hr><p><b>Phyllis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic movie! Acting, script, visuals -- all mesmorizing! Thanks Andrew for the monologue, if it's not totally accurate I'd be surprised.</p><hr><p><b>IronLight</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A voracious version of vestigial government verifiably made viable by voracious events in which the virtues of the valiant are vamped and envisioned in a single virtuous vestibule known as V. Easily the best movie I can think of ever having seen. No other movie combines real world events and predictions with the hope that there is immovable virtue hiding out there somewhere. I'll be looking forward to November 5th this year to see if anyone tries anything. ;)</p><hr><p><b>brian</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>While the movie is quite good, this version of the script is terrible and is not half as incredible of what the movie is.</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I can honestly say that V for Vendetta is, without a doubt, one the best movies of the year. The storyline is superb, the acting spectacular. I will definitely see this over and over again.</p><hr><p><b>Slider</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have now seen this movie four times, it's amazing! But it also helps that I work at a movie theatre and don't have to pay to see it... but you know! I want to see the literation monologue of V's done by V (just like everyone else who has commented, practically) right after the Fingermen find Evey in the alley. I laughed all the way through it the first time, mostly just because I laugh at everything and talk way too much. Totally finished now!</p><hr><p><b>Diane</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie! I've watched it three times so far, brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely brilliant. Definitely will be seeing this one several times more. The final script was much better than this one, and as such my rating is meant for IT, not this version.</p><hr><p><b>Mendez</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I loved the film and the dialogs, but the script is very incomplete.</p><hr><p><b>Brittany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome script, great use of Shakespeare. I have to go again just to hear the language!</p><hr><p><b>ARC</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The film was great. I was disappointed that V's  monologue was not in the script, but thanks to Andrew Untersee for his rendition.</p><hr><p><b>Ariane</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely loved this movie. One of the best movies I have EVER seen! I can't wait until the script they used comes out. I'll be using quotes everywhere I go. Although, this script is awful, especially the last scene with Evey and V. That was my favorite scene in the whole movie (with the exception of the falling dominos and the kick-ass fight scene at the end) and it just seemed so unfullfilled in this version. I'm glad they changed what they did, to think that that movie could've been horrible!</p><hr><p><b>forte</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I do not know how long it took to memorise the script, but that's one well written script. And don't you love it when a movie has great script, acting and a plot that you can almost relate to. Excellent.</p><hr><p><b>dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie was sweet.  Seeing it was a truly great movie-going experience, comparable to what it must have been like to go see a movie in the golden age of cinema.  However, I must say things that will clearly annoy people on this posting site.  I thought that there were some things that make this movie fall short of being a GREAT movie worthy of being noted in cinematic history.  For example, the love story was awkwardly developed and the audience was left wondering how to feel about the whole fake imprisonment thing.  These small development aspects of the film  were extremely disappointing because they were some of the only things holding back this sweetly made movie.</p><hr><p><b>Thomas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>12 out of 10.  I went and saw it three days ago and have seen it every day since.  I think this was better than the combined forces of all six Star Wars movies.</p><hr><p><b>Quinlin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I went to go see this just hours ago. Its plot was creative and powerful. Its characters complex and mysterious. Excellent filming techniques with amazing dialogue. It was compelling and I shall hope to never forget it.</p><hr><p><b>NOV 5th</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so pro.</p><hr><p><b>Paris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Reaper</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this film. BEST EVER. Fantastic!</p><hr><p><b>Rose</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is fantastic. I love the monologue. "An idea can change the world". I tried to copy it at the theater but it was too fast. Simply brilliant. We need our own Revolution to give us Hope and I started Save America after that film.</p><hr><p><b>art</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Veracious, virtous, vestal and veridical. The real winner was the beauty and power of LANGUAGE. Kids, please read the second largest selling book in the world, the dictionary, use adjectives and adverbs as a form of self expression, do not conform to your peers ideals.

Ideas and ART, that ideas start a revolution, that with nothing else, we have ideas, that the repressed turn to art for self expression. If you haven't yet, you soon will. 

Anarchy or revolution? What shape will it take? A world shortage of water, a middle eastern country that doesn't believe in the new world order and seeks equality.... ironically revengeful at aggresive neighbours.

An oppressive worlwide regime supported by lacklustre subversive governments whose submission is forced through economic control and foreign debt. Will the self-involved, obsessive, ambivalent masses have the strength of will and courage to wear a mask, to follow a revolutionary. Will that revolutionary be the second coming of GOD? 

Will liberalism prevail in a state where the wealthy purchase the health of the poor... organs for sale, if you will. 

10 Rating is for the movie script, the earlier script lacks what the final script delivers on, INTELLIGENCE.</p><hr><p><b>Robyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Beautiful, I'll never forget the gunpowder treason and plot.</p><hr><p><b>Nicko</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This script is missing the best monologue when V first appears where he rolls off all the V words. I'm looking for that bit in particular to add to a theatre piece I'm working on. Can anyone help me find it?</p><hr><p><b>Luffy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Just saw this movie yesterday and I must say WOW. It was the first 'real' movie I have seen in a while. The language, music and action were so sophisticated. IT WAS AWSOME! I wanna see it again and again until I like memorize everything.</p><hr><p><b>Chiper</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I greatly enjoyed reading this script since there is a lot of detail in it that isn't in the movie, but I'm very glad that this wasnt the final screenplay. This lacks a lot of the punch that the film had, missing almost all of V's best oneliners and it makes V into much more of a coldblooded killer than he was in the film. I also thought that while Helen was an interesting subplot, she wasn't nessisary to the story and ended up just confusing me at times. The movie was brilliant, but this script is lackluster at best.</p><hr><p><b>Axel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The 'correct' monologue to introduce to Evey is this:

"Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only veredict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V". Great movie!</p><hr><p><b>steff</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever! It's so well done and the background a one of a kind.

As a rating for this splendid film, 9/10 because I cannot help but notice that there were only 3 fight scenes. However the story flows perfectly and too many may be a bit much.</p><hr><p><b>Hayley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was excellent, I've never witnessed anything like it! I may be young, fourteen to be exact, but the concept was basic enough for a mere teenager to grasp but yet advanced enough for those who like to challenge themselves. It made me think, wonder and also cry. It had a bit of everything, action, performance, drama, romance, death and dare I say it education. I recommened for all to see V For Vendetta.</p><hr><p><b>konstantis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Can't wait for the 5th of November.</p><hr><p><b>Tiffany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this film was PHENOMENAL!

It was an unapologetic look at a social milieu, which stripped of the fantastic veneer, is becoming all too familiar in the world today. V For Vendetta, albeit not one of the many scripts that can be found circulating was well written and thought-provoking. The rendering was a visual masterpiece underlined by the powerful performance of Natalie Portman. Surely her first work that can wash away the ungodly reminants of the Star Wars Trilogy.</p><hr><p><b>pure_anarchist</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This country, and even this entire world needs a massive revolution, and after seeing this movie I WANT TO LEAD IT!</p><hr><p><b>Atrusino</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw it twice in the theater and loved it.

      </p><hr><p><b>Adhe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>FANTASTIC movie. I saw it 3 times in the theatre and the day the DVD came out I bought the collector's edition. It was not only an emotionally moving picture tugging at the "free the people" strings of my own heart, but it was ravaged with the glory once held by the English language. V's monologue was an example of alliteration at its peak. While I'm not the most apt at using the "verbose verbiage" to my advantage, I greatly appreciate it and the use in this film helped to draw me closer to the edge of my seat.</p><hr><p><b>Rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I already saw this movie 3 times and now I own it on dvd. I was the first one to buy it from the dvd shop in my town because I knew when they were going to release. I don't regret for one second that I bought it, it's worth every cent. Well Done Wachowski Brothers! This is a star studded movie and should make everyone think about freedom. Brilliant movie. Gosh I want some popcorn tonight with my movie V for Vendetta! Got to go, I can't wait to see it!</p><hr><p><b>zach</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing. I don't get out to the theatre much, but saw this on dvd when it came out. It was so good on the small screen it makes me want to rent out a theatre and watch it on the big screen. I really wanted to know what he was saying during his speech with all the v-words (it was sometimes hard to catch all that he was saying).

It seems to be a lot more like the graphic novel than the eventual script. But it wouldn't work as well on the silver screen as the later script did. I loved the V for Vendetta movie. I just bought the dvd and I just can't get enough of it, there are some parts that are a bit off and also some that have a clear 'matrixy' influence about it (victori-station). Nevertheless, for me this is the perfect movie; it has drama, poetry, mystery, humor, an amazing (anti) hero, great actors (what Hugo Weaving does with just his voice is amazing) great visual and sound effects, beautiful scenery. I bought the graphic novel since I saw the movie. It cost me quite a lot of money but it was totally worth it. I found it different from the movie, Evey is a lot more child like and a lot more different aspects about V are told, like how V blew up larkhill. I can recommend it to everyone both the movie and the graphic novel. Now we only have to wait till the later script comes on this site.

I've seen the movie 14 times now and am still in love with it. Another thing that disappointed me was that Evey and V never really "got" together, just one good pash would have made it perfection. However the movie is still the best movie in history.</p><hr><p><b>Alfred</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>People don't seem to realize that in most movies there is an original script and a transcript, most often the original is too vague and complex for most people to have the wit to comprehend. Transcripts are created to make things easier, as it were. I agree V's monologue was superb and I'm highly disappointed myself as to not having found it online, but I believe the orginal script has more depth and is much more vigorating than the transcript. Perhaps if there was a way to have been able to incorporate V's dialogues from the transcript to the original script the movie would have been much more climactic for me as well.</p><hr><p><b>Scarlet Carson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have ever, EVER seen. It doesn't scream perfection. It shouts that it has beaten it. V for Vendetta casts a spell on you that only the disappointment of the end credits can break (but then you want to see the movie again). Although there were a few aspects of the movie that were different to the script. Why wasn't Evey a prostitue in the movie? That's one thing I want answered.</p><hr><p><b>Charlotte</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>On its own, the movie's OK, but it's TERRIBLY disappointing if you've read the graphic novels. The graphic novels are BRILLIANT and the movie pales in comparision. The movie failed to keep the themes and characters intact and overall the result was a weak, typical Hollywood drone.</p><hr><p><b>bhas</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think the film is very interesting, because that films combines drama and action. You must watch this film or you'll be a spoilsport.</p><hr><p><b>The Villan.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love films that dare to venture into places that most do not. Sure we've all seen films about government conspiracy, but this one isn't government conspiracy but a government disguised as a dictatorship. And I find that V would later stand for the society that doesn't have all the rules and curfews and what-not. I also come to find that the audiences are mostly composed of teens, (as am I) who hoped more for action than romance or deep stuff. But all who watch this movie will enjoy it, or your soul back. And also to add to this movie, I thought it would have been better if V didn't die. Because that's sad. And I don't like to cry at movies. But it made me. Darn it (and if I don't make much sense, try to understand that I rarely ever do).</p><hr><p><b>TaintedPaladin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What can I say. Like any movie, it had a few faults, to be technical, but all in all. Who am I kidding! It cast light on the morality of our current government and social echelons, raising the question of how low will people sink in order to protect themselves physically. The answer was easily interpreted. Too low. Humanity is fragile, made moreso by the fragility of the human condition and the lack of moral convictions present in the setting. V is a key pivotal point in all aspects of their society, government and of their people. He serves as a symbol of the integration of all the previous, yet illuminates the eccentricities that accentuate each. Through him, we are able to see the roles they play on each of the other two, yet are brought to understand V's, and sometimes the peoples, perspectives on each. ANYWAYS, I have some studying to catch up on, and I'll continue this at a later time. Hope this has interested you, and possibly brought you to think a little deeper into the subliminal aspects of V for Vendetta.</p><hr><p><b>Sebastian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing depth.

I sat at the edge of my seat the entire duration, I don't even recall blinking during the entire film. This movie had a relatable theme, and every scene was more powerful than the next. The acting was phenomonal, as was the plot. Two scenes in the movie made me cry! The wording is so powerful that you can actually feel each character's anguish and emotion. I literally danced and jumped around when I purchased the DVD. I entered the theatre with little expectation, since I knew nothing of the story, and exited in total awe. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a dramatic movie that stays with you!</p><hr><p><b>Robert Hyde</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow! What an utterly exhilirating and fantabulous movie! Nothing I see could be changed to make it any better. Hoorah!</p><hr><p><b>Tiff!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I totally loved the film. They may have changed the script into one softer but the films keeps its dramatical and moral side intact! I thought Natalie Portman was exceptional, I wasn't sure I wanted to see the movie but after I saw her acting I was completly elsewhere you know? She's so convincing that I almost fell for her LOL !
About the plot, it was incredible !
More than 2 scenes made me cry and I felt like it was a real lesson for me who's afraid of. Many thing. Well, this movie is a chef-d'oeuvre!</p><hr><p><b>Darren</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Read the graphic novels!</p><hr><p><b>Adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That movie inspired me to get out and proverbially blow up the parliament in my own life.</p><hr><p><b>Don Carlo Quita</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watched this way before and I just commented on it today. It's what my rating says it is. Excellent! I don't agree with my ENG102 instructor saying that it was not good because it was all just words. She of all people should know appreciate the political value of that. Anyway, I recommend this to anybody that happens to glance on this page!</p><hr><p><b>neo anderson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Point of interest. They had a march on washington dc in "v" outfits.</p><hr><p><b>S</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THIS MOVIE IS awesome! I'm like obsessed with it now! And the speech with all those V's is very confusing. I wonder how Hugo Weaving managed to memorize it. AHHHHHHH! IT'S SO GOOD! I like the final script from the movie better.</p><hr><p><b>Lydia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>V totally my heroes! Our integrity, the very last inch of us!</p><hr><p><b>DavidT</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Remember remember the fifth of November. This is definitely one of the best movies of all times. It's just so poetic, inspiring and intriguing. I loved every moment of it, it makes you cry, it makes you think, it makes you dream, it makes you smile and in some rare occasions, it makes you laugh. A brilliant representation of the totalitarianism in some societies and incites you to think out of the box and to ask yourself, am I really somebodies puppet? Am I really just a piece in someones chess? I loved the scripted but I was a bit disappointed that they omitted V's monologue with all those Vs (Thanks andru, I checked it while watching the movie and it is just fine).</p><hr><p><b>imiture</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A great film, superbly written and directed. A few of my friends didn't like it and recommended me not to watch it, true cinema is for a select few.</p><hr><p><b>vivek(V)</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I have seen so far and I think there cannot be another movie that can beat this movie ever. The monologue is awesome.</p><hr><p><b>A Friend</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The first thing I want to say is, this is probably the best movie I've ever seen. And the best movie I ever will see. The person who recommended this movie to me is very important in my life. I think I am in love with him. But that's not the point. This movie is amazing, and I congratulate Hugo Weaving on his perfect impersonation of the character V. And I just have to say that when I first saw this movie, I fell in love with WEaving's character, V. I was in love with his harshly beautiful mask, and his whole black outfit. When the movie was over, I missed him. I missed seeing his face. How much of a dork am I?</p><hr><p><b>Tricx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I hadnt heard of the movie until I saw previews for it to be shown on Pay-Per-View where the name REALLY caught my attention. I rented it one night to see what it was like and loved it so much I went to a local Wal-Mart and bought it after it finished. Since then I must have watched it about 15 times. BY FAR THE BEST Movie I have seen in AGES. I don't think another movie this great will be released again anytime in the next 5 years.</p><hr><p><b>Guy Crosswell</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>An excellent film, I love V's extensive vocabulary. I'm so envious, I reckon that the plot was amazing, the best idea used in a film for many years. However the film had more potential with such an outstanding plot but still a 9 out of 10. Best line: 'I'm merely remarking on the paradox of asking a masked man who he is'.</p><hr><p><b>kim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the film, it was just my sort of thing and despite the actor being underneath the mask I fell in love with "V's" character! You made him seem mad but with the manners of a gentleman which made me feel almost sorry for V because he may have been wrong in the head in a different way, but he had the ideas and views of a well balanced man.</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved both the movie and comic, but it seems to me that parts of the script are different but I still like it.</p><hr></td>
