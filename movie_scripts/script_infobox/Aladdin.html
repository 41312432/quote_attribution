I would like to meet him. I liked A Whole New World and I also liked jafar. I'm thinking to write a script myself.</p><hr><p><b>Lou(x)</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is a classic fairytale story! Great music and the cartoons look really pretty. I love that song a whole new world. I never get bored of that song. My fave character is Jasmin. Jordan and Peter Andre sing the new version of the whole new world song! They should take note of what the original classic song sounded like.</p><hr><p><b>vhel</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This is a great fairytale story. The flow was good and really fascinating. How I'd wish to have a magic lamp like Aladdin.</p><hr><p><b>alexis</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>That was good but the setting was very mixed up, like it was Egypt and India. They need to do better on that.</p><hr><p><b>omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The greatest disney film of all time.</p><hr><p><b>MAICIE</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That was exhilarating! A one of its kind movie experience.</p><hr><p><b>Jonathan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really love Aladdin.  It's a wonderful movie with unforgetable and caring characters. My favorite of course is Genie because he's so funney and voiced by one of my favorite comedians Robin Williams.  My 2 favorite scenes with Genie is when he says Are you lookin at me? did you rub my lamp? did you wake me up? did you bring me here? and all of sudden you walkin out on me? I don't think so not right now you're getting your wishes so sit down! and I also liked it when he turned himself into a sheep and he says all right ya baaaaaddddd boy but no more freebees! Those pretty cool hillarious lines from Genie and he and the rest of the characters are pretty cool and funney! Aladdin also has wonderful songs written by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice.  My favorite is Friend Like Me sung by Genie.   Aladdin is a true animation classic that's good for now and the future!</p><hr><p><b>J</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite movie since I was a little girl. I've always had a huge crush on Aladdin. The voice acting is great, and I love the three colored theme: Blue = Good Red = Bad Yellow = Neutral. 

The only thing I'm confused about is the timeline. Jasmine is rushed into getting married because of her birthday which is in a few days, and then she doesn't get married until the third movie! I guess her father made another exception. :P

The music happens to be my favorite in any Disney movie. All of the songs are very well written, and they aren't boring or too long. I own the original VHS version, and the DVD version.

Alexis, they created their very own world of Aladdin. The setting wasn't in any real life place, and so Agrabah really is like Egypt and India both. If they had made it like one or the other, everyone would assume that's where they really were.

</p><hr><p><b>Tiffany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really am in love with Aladdin. It's so magical, enchanting, lovely, beautiful and there's a little sense of humour in it. I love Genie, he's so funny and lovable. They story is beautiful and the best. They took two lovers from totally opposite backgrounds, one poor and always wanting to live like the riches, the other rich but unhappy, wondering how life outside palace would be, and put them together, how 2 very very different point of views can turn into one, because both satisfies what the other needs. Did I mention that Aladdin's a very charming guy? That I'm in LOVE with him, as in REAL LOVE. haha. This movie is good for all ages and will never fall to what the new disney makes nowadays. New Di$ney is wrong if they think they can beat the classics. Well, if they do, I'd wish them good luck. Goodbye for now, I'm going to rewatch this movie until I get tired of it.(which I never will)</p><hr><p><b>clement</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really am in love with Aladdin.
