why is my life depictied in this script?

i almost couldnt stand it.   almost.</p><hr><p><b>ian</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>this is so much more depressing that the movie version. I agree with adam, though, it is far more realistic. I like the movie because it presents a optimistic view, but I appreciate this script because it offers a much more true-to-life picture of the idea of memory erasure, and relationships as they more often are.

So for that reason, I don't like the script as much as the movie - If I want to be depressed about life, I'll dwell on it as it really is. Otherwise, I'll dream of a better place - my "movie version"</p><hr><p><b>rishi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>it's a great movie every young men ought to watch movie</p><hr><p><b>Dj</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>my god this is my fave movie....im in love with it...it changed my life ...i have an obssession...the plot is ingenious and the actors did a wonderful and heart warming job on this film...i secretly give it a higher rating...*tee hee* out of ten stars it was awesome...(15 stars)</p><hr><p><b>DB</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My life. On film.  The horror!</p><hr><p><b>Alice</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>yeah, i just finished watching this movie and its awesome. its a great film.  i love clemintine. she's implusive, witty, beautiful and lives for the moment....</p><hr><p><b>Fiona</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing film, amazing script. A beautiful movie and definitely in my top two favorite films ever. </p><hr><p><b>Kay</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Is it too early to declare this as my favorite movie ever?</p><hr><p><b>Andi</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Very unconventional plot.</p><hr><p><b>MS05-046</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow I haven't watched the movie yet but the script is... wow, i don't find a word for it. I want to watch the movie, but I want to wait a little time before. I don't know why... just... I also saw myself in it.</p><hr><p><b>Wish</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Beautiful movie... made me cry so much.</p><hr><p><b>Mogul</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely one of my most favorite movies.  I like the changes made to the original script.  The movie was made perfectly!</p><hr><p><b>Toxicating</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely LOVE this movie. It made me cry aswell at the end. Such a beautiful story line and script. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet were brilliant in this movie. Definitely one of my faves!</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script is just superb! It's very original and the characters are all interesting. One of the best.</p><hr><p><b>Deb</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ok, here is me, going against the grain. I love the movie so much, it is my favorite movie and it only goes to show my true love for it that I read the script. One thing that bothered me after reading the script was why it wasn't shown as it was. I mean, yes, the movie was another happy ending and the actors were brilliant and the characters were moving but I love this version. I love its raw edges, I love the truth of the story with Mary and the way that Joel and Clementine reacted to their tapes. It was truth and vision, in the movie the moral was "love will find a way" and the script was "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it". There is so much difference there. I also love how the script shows both sides of Mary's point of view, on one hand people need to know what goes on with their life, on the other there are some horrific things happening in the world and maybe its better if we just can forget. My take on the movie was, that no one should have the ability to edit their lives and it shows just how ignorant people are to choose to forget a lesson learned. This is a good movie, a better script though.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Anyone who doesn't like this movie should go to a different planet.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous2</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This is a very overrated movie. Everybody knows that memories can be erased. Lacuna is 3 streets down my house, in fact I went last year to erase  all my common sense and taste in good movies (subconscience: that explains why I am writing this awful comment).</p><hr><p><b>Tony</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Wow I really don't know what to say. I guess it was a bad idea to read this after seeing the movie. That being said, I enjoyed the movie a great deal more than the script. The script ends on such a down note as opposed to the movie which ends in hope. Script was good, movie was superior.</p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the story. Though in real life I wish memories could be erased so I could move on and love again.</p><hr><p><b>thura</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Actually I didn't like Jim & Kate. But in that movie, they are so rhythmic. Screenplay is nice. Mostly, it is not a comedy but satire.</p><hr><p><b>Andrei</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I can sincerely say that I very much enjoyed the plot, the acting, and the movie as a whole. However, I do not agree at all with the what commonly seems to be acknowledged as the hopeful ending. People do not give each other another go, not after knowing exactly how the relationship was, the weaknesses, arguments, disappointments and all the other, besides the positive things about it. Regardless, what really matters is the fact that they did break up. This is why I do not believe that Joel and Clementine stay together after the ending. Nevertheless, apart from the ambiguity of the ending of this highly controversial film, I think it is a wonderful accomplishment, and definitely a must-see. Overall fantastic, and instinctively deserving a 10-star rating.</p><hr><p><b>Randi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What a mind-blower this is. Love the quirkiness. It's my fave flick. If that makes me weird, oh well. I'm sure there's many others who'd speak the same. It has an awesome dreamy sense to, kind of like a trance, which reminds me of The Cell, but this movie owns the other one big-time. Clementine is a cool girl, and I loved getting to know her throughout the script. This one I actually took time to read like a book. A good piece of work, I'd say. Her boyfriend is such a boring contrast to her, but what goes on in his head, is a tad more interesting. I like the mind-trip the film takes people on, it even transcends to the script alone, but I'm glad to have experienced both. If you haven't seen the movie yet, it's such a visually-stimulating flick. Her hair is like a parrot's and the different sets of scenery happen to fascinate me... 'cause it's fascinating. There you have it, in one word. How thought-provoking this fragment of high art.</p><hr><p><b>Erik</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Incredible how different the script is!  The movie was done perfectly in the sense that the parts left out, are better left implied or to the imagination (Elaborate explanations, Back story with Naomi, Nudity, the years-later Sci-Fi aspect!!!)
What would Eternal Sunshine be without "Meet me in Montauk?!!!

Would Joel and Clementine learn from their prior mistakes???  Did hearing the tape teach them anything?  I liked how the movie let the viewer use their imagination.</p><hr><p><b>greg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie I have ever seen! It was heart-warming yet heart-breaking at the same time. I cried like 6 times. God I love that movie.</p><hr><p><b>dinda nancy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The film and the script are both twisted! In a good way. Emotionally painful. Suddenly I lost my vocabulary to describe how amazing the film is. So beautiful, I'm actually using the film as my final psychoanalysis thesis. Wish me luck.</p><hr><p><b>pat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Thank god the script was changed, it was incredibly pessimistic. The actual film is fantastic. One of the most beautiful things I've experienced. Charlie is incredibly talented but Michel makes his work truly shine. Perfect movie. One of my favorites.</p><hr><p><b>A. Alexander</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Terrible screenplay. Weak descriptions, fluff filled dialogue, pretentious characters. The story creates the illusion of intelligence, prodding along, trying to make its female lead as synthetically unique as possible. Their relationship is riddled with melodramatic exchanges and blatantly irrational choices. Clementine is as dull as a rock and as boring as her run by the mill life-style. Joel is weakly written and emotionally simple. Mediocre movie, even worse screenplay.</p><hr><p><b>John Doe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of a class movies I ever saw! Jim in his role was awesome and Kate obviously super awesome. That's the reason why it's an award winning movie. Kudos.</p><hr><p><b>Gil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script is infinitely better than the movie. The reason is that the ending in the movie is inconclusive. It doesn't show if their relationship works the second time around. I think the original script is a masterpiece. When you read the script you will understand that Charlie wanted to present an account of those two people's entire lives, and how they love each other but can't live with each other. It was supposed to be THE movie about relationships, but the actual movie is merely good. Read the script.</p><hr><p><b>Debs</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>This movie is grossly overrated. Why cheer for a relationship that I couldn't care less about.</p><hr></td>
