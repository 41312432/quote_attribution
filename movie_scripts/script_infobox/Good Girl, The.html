    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Lila</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>This film is so disgusting! The only person I liked here is John C Reilly. Jake was too weak for his role and Jennifer's face was so gloomy! But, I think it'll be nice to read this script.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loved this film. It was a good mix of comedy and drama, you can't really put it in a category. I thought Jennifer Aniston wasn't really the right person to play Justine. She is more suited to Romcoms. But she did a good job of it though.
John C Reilly was fantastic, really lifted the movie as it was very dark in places. But all that said I really liked it. And I think the script will be a good read.</p><hr><p><b>Charlotte</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This film is absolutely revolting. The main character (the apparent "good" girl) is a terrible, horrible, disgusting, filthy excuse for a human being. All she does is mope and whine about how rotten her life is, yet she does everything in her power to KEEP the life she hates- lies, cheats, treats people horribly, attempt MURDER, for Christ's sake, and in the end comdemns her own child to living a sham. There's absolutely nothing to like about her. She's a coward, an adulteress, a liar, and overall a despicable waste of human flesh. There's nothing "good" about her. The one and only likeable character in this film is Jake Gyllenhaal's Holden Worther, who basically takes crap from everyone for being a quality person in a town of nobodies. Jake Gyllenhaal was the only good thing about this film.</p><hr><p><b>james</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>What, the Good Girl? Has there EVER been a more misleading movie title? This girl isn't good, she's HORRIBLE! She makes me want to vomit! Are we supposed to feel SORRY for her? All she does is lie and cheat and whine! All she cares about is herself and her reputation, nothing and no one else. At the end I just wanted to shove a pitchfork up her behind. She's so selfish and obsessed with her own misery, "Oh my life sucks, waaaah," so she goes around ruining everyone's lives. No sympathy at all for her. Worst movie I've ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>Astrid</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Ummm how can anyone possibly like this movie? The character Justine is a horrid bitch. When she's not whining she's trying to poison people to death and smearing peoples' names for the sake of her reputation and I just felt like killing her! Honestly! I really hated her. She's the worst movie character I know, I kid not. She's a loathable whore. She's below contempt. And Jennifer Aniston simply CAN'T ACT. At all. Jake Gyllenhaal was great though.</p><hr><p><b>Holden Caulfield Lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>The only good thing to be gained from this movie is the brilliant character of Holden Worther. I loved him. I really related to him. He was the only good thing about this movie. The rest of the characters, they just give him hell. Aniston mastered two emotions here: bored and confused. Aniston is such a bad actress that it blinds me and her character just pisses me off. She's so irritating, whining all the time, complaining about how much she hates her life, and then CHOOSING to remain miserable at the cost of another person's LIFE. She's so sullen and doesn't change at all throughout the movie- she just has no passion at all, she just cares about her reputation. She's such a coward, no matter how much she hates her life she makes NO ATTEMPT to get out of the dead-end life she hates. Quite stupid how she spends most of the film bitching about how bad she has it, only to choose remain in that life out of cowardice. What's more, the way she treated Holden was a horror to behold. What was the point of the film?</p><hr><p><b>darren</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>What was the point? Whiny Aniston sleeps around, her lover is mentally ill and she treats him like something she scraped off her shoe. She lies and lies because she's a coward and in the end she's basically screwed everybody over with her lies. Her husband was right to slap her! I just wish he'd taken it further and killed her. Did Aniston feel that she had to sleep with 3 guys to prove her acting talent? Not worth my time.</p><hr><p><b>Sue</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This was a brilliant movie. Jennifer Aniston has outdone herself, and one can see she's not just the girl next door. Seems though everyone else thought her character was "horrible" and "disgusting". Maybe you guys just don't get the movie. I propose you watch it again in a few years!</p><hr><p><b>Colorado</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>It was actually quite well-written and I think it could've been great, there was some real potential here. But personally I lost all sympathy for the main character and by the end I was so fed up I regretted wasting my time on this movie. Well-written does not equal substance.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Here's an idea. Isn't it possible that the title "The Good Girl" is supposed to be ironic? Movies don't always have to be about rainbows and happy little elves you know. I admit that Jennifer Aniston's performance wasn't spectacular, but don't dump on a movie because the main character wasn't nice enough for you.</p><hr><p><b>Suzie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I agree sue, I mean you really have to watch the movie with a whole other perspective. You're not supposed to be feeling sorry for Aniston, you're supposed to get a view of someone else's life and the choices they make along the way that causes them the consequences they receive. Maybe it's supposed to open your eyes as an audience to look at yourself and realize at one time in your life you were probably just as "horrible" as Aniston. Just see that and maybe you'll think differently.</p><hr><p><b>Zeke</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Many people who found this film revolting are two things: honest and mislead. The Good Girl is an explicit film about the abuse of the idea of morals. It's a dark comedy, and dark comedies are always somewhat disturbing or disgusting. Take 1989's Heather's. Winona Ryder killed her own best friends, and in the end had an overwhelming, cool sense of accomplishment. All the Good Girl really wanted to say, was a simple yet complex story about the exhausting struggle of femininty and morals. How we somehow forget the right thing when our lives don't hand us the right things. The way you judge the film is all based on your own empathy. I felt for not only the main character, but all of them. They had no real feeling of who they are or what they do, all they know is what makes them feel good or what keep's them living. Jennifer Aniston is nothing short of perfection, her brilliance is in the little things, like the way she walks, the way she jumps to so innocent to kiss Holden, how frighten and guilty she feels when confronted about her affair. Each and ever emotion is always written across her face. Jake Gyllenhaal proves he is one of the greatest and most diverse actors, young or old, of today. And by the way, the film's title suggests everything Justine isn't. If you remember Justine's boss called her a good girl for turning in Holden, but he also had no idea what it had taken Justine do so.</p><hr><p><b>Shannel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You people are stupid for critisizing Justine, I don't even want to explain myself. Just quit being so one sighted. Jeez.</p><hr><p><b>Marqus</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Ohh come on people. The movie was fantastic! Lighten up a bit. It's just a movie. And the title "The Good Girl" is supposed to be off the beaten path. For entertainment purposes only! That's exactly what it did and still does for me. The movie holds a very special memory for me with a very special someone and I LOVE IT! It's not at all possible, but I would LOVE to see a second part.</p><hr><p><b>Connor</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I really loved this movie. It was really funny in certain places, and sometimes really dramatic. Some of the scenes were so. WOW.</p><hr><p><b>Ireland Emerald</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>You know, this could have been a good move if Justine wasn't always bitchin' how terrible her life is. Then she is willing to let some1 die so she can stay in her oh - so - terrible life. I actually felt sorry for Jennifer Aniston because she had to play her. I mean, God, how could Justine go around sleeping with random guys, it's so disgusting! If I had to choose who did the best acting, I'd say Jake Gyllenhaal & John c. Reilly were the best actors. Justine Was so damn whiny.</p><hr><p><b>Ruby</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I can't believe some people don't like this movie, it's one of the most true films ever! I was so sick of films having cheesy happy endings but The Good Girl was so different and real, it felt like what would really happen in that type of situation. I also think Jennifer Aniston's acting skills were good at playing a bored character, which is hard to do, and Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing to watch.</p><hr><p><b>KDizzle</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I had to watch this for a report in class; I agree the character Justine was a bit of a slut it seemed (sorry; quote from canis ca) and I loved when Phil slapped her. But, the point was that she was living another life, hiding and sneaking, she even says she likes having a secret. Its all about imagery. Holden is her way of escaping the mundane crap with Phil and Bubba (who's a scum bag- I'd love to smash his face in). Calling it the "good girl" isn't misleading at all; she's the good girl in the beginning even if she's depressed. Even if she cheated on Phil and everyone totally knew what she was up to; she wasn't hiding it as well as she thought; and that's what made it all come together. She told on Holden in the end choosing Phil over a life on the run. Though it was generally immoral, and I don't like women who cheat; its degrading to my gender; once you scratch the surface you see it. There's so much more at play. However I hate sex scenes. I covered my eyes in class. We really didn't need to see any of that. Ew. Okay. My rants done.</p><hr><p><b>maccastarr</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Good Girl is a great movie, one of my all time favorites. The characters were greatly casted, and the script was classic. Life can become boring and tedious which is why people explore for something new and exciting. Unfortunately, some people make the wrong choices and change the lives of their own, and the people around them. Mike White did a wonderful job with the script.</p><hr><p><b>Suzi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was well written, well cast and had tons of great irony! This movie makes you think about how easily you can mess up your life by making decisions based on your own selfishness.</p><hr><p><b>elvorie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I would like to see Jennifer Aniston in more movie roles that are totally not taken from her own character.</p><hr><p><b>katie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The title is supposed to be ironic. Of course Justine is not a good girl, she makes very selfish choices, lies, and leads on a guy with a mental illness (it doesn't take a genius to figure out that Holden was not alright in the brain). The fact that she chooses to keep lying leads to her getting into more and more trouble. Obviously she should have just told Phil that she was unhappy and told the truth about her affair, this would have prevented her from having sex with Bubba just to keep a secret. Which I think is a lesson this movie really wants you to learn, that lying will only lead to people getting hurt worse than what they would have if you had just told the truth. Another thing that makes this movie appealing is that you can relate to Justine even though she seems like such a bad person. People often try to live out fantasies, even ones we got from TV, movies, or childhood dreams. Justine is sick of her mundane life with her pothead husband and she see's Holden as exciting, good looking, and ultimately the escape she's been looking for. She uses Holden as a way to live out a fantasy, so she can be with a man that is what she wanted Phil to be. The biggest lesson of this movie is about the dangers of trying to run away from reality. Life is boring sometimes and it almost never plays out like a fairy tale, but you can't run away from reality. The more you try the harder reality is going to smack you in the face so hard you can't see straight. That's exactly what happens in the end, reality smacks Justine right in the face. And she faces the consequences of trying to live out a fantasy.</p><hr><p><b>Irene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Stop posting so much nasty comments! You guys are so negative! If you're going to say something, you mind as well say some good stuff.</p><hr><p><b>Faith</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>1. It's supposed to be ironic. 2. It's not Jennifer's life, it's Justine's. Team Jolie stop hating and being complete idiot trolls. 3. Jen is the best female actor there is and Jake is the best male actor.</p><hr><p><b>Faith</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>How is her character disgusting?! She LOVED Jake and had to stay with her husband because she was confused. And she was pretty well raped by her husband's friend. A DUR. How do you idiots not comprehend that?.</p><hr><p><b>Stephanie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie. It's tragic, romantic and I was just really into the story. Not to mention I have a huge crush on Jake Gyllenhal at that age (I love Donnie Darko too.). But being unbiased, I love how depressed he is and all he wants to do is run away with her. It secret they shared was so exciting to me. However, it made me so mad how Justine tried to get rid of him, even though her life absolutely sucked and she was in love with him. If that were me, I would run away with him in a heartbeat.</p><hr><p><b>Mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This film is fantastic and the reactions prove that. Think about your comments and ratings a bit longer before plopping down that "1". It's really ok to not like a film and give it the higher mark that it deserves. Especially so when referring to character complexities that draw obvious irony from the title.</p><hr><p><b>R</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Faith is an example of everything wrong with women today. RAPED? Are you kidding? Aniston's character compounded her offense by sleeping with his best friend to protect her lie and you call it rape? No one forced her; she couldn't face up to just what an awful person she was so she whores her way out of the situation. Yes, she was blackmailed, but she chose to be a whore. She should have told her husband. The movie was okay, but Faith, get real. Aniston played a most loathsome character. A truly worthless person with no character at all. At the moment it is hard for me to think of a more disgusting human being in any film I've seen. It's not the affair that makes her loathsome. Anyone can have an affair- it happens. It's the endless deceit that makes her what she is. Lie and cover up at all cost- others' cost- not her's. The movie's title says it all- it is ironic. This is a story of a truly selfish horrid person with no ethics, no self worth and no capacity to change. Again, the movie was pretty good and it is sad but true that so many women are just like her, but please do not even try to defend her. This is a movie that finally shows the truth about how despicable some women can be. Don't try to make her a sympathetic character. If that was supposed to be the goal in making this film, they failed miserably. And the last bit with Gyllenhaal's story- well. That's what she should have done, gotten out of the life she whines about instead of ruining the lives of so many others by doing whatever suits her. At last a filmmaker brave enough to expose some reality about the twisted way most women think and behave.</p><hr><p><b>N</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You guys don't need to keep complaining. It's just a movie. The movie probably had to be made that way. Sops; You got a good point.</p><hr></td>
