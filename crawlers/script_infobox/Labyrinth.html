I don't even know where the dialogue came from!</p><hr><p><b>Hailey girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the coolest~~~!!!!!!!!1</p><hr><p><b>Brytanne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I cant watch any other movie, its sooooo addicting!!!</p><hr><p><b>Rochelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing, and such a joy to watch. I'm addicted. Although, I've red through the script you have posted and it is not the same as the movie I have watched. I still love it, but the movie is better.
</p><hr><p><b>Me person</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'd like to say this movie is great and I love it 
And to clarify for those people who said that this isn't the script to Jim Henson's Labyrinth, it is. This is the first draft by Terry Jones. It was then looked over by Jim Henson and Terry Jones had to go back and make alot of changes. So don't start assuming, it is the script to Labyrinth, but just not the final shooting script</p><hr><p><b>the nibster</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>absolutely spiffing</p><hr><p><b>Princess Bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Caryn - 

Well duh! This is the *original script*. My brother is a screenwriter, so I have the knowlege that scripts change 15 billion times before a movie is done. The baby "Freddie" was renamed Toby after Brian Frouds baby boy. Also Jim Henson added a *lot* of his own vision. He helped Terry in renaming the book, changing the speach, even altering the premise. In the final work jareth comes off as less of an ass. I am particularly fond of many of the changes that were made. But This *is* the Script to what would become Jim Henson's The Labyrinth.</p><hr><p><b>karina</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>isn't the babys name supposed to be TOBY??!?!?!?!?!? the script was totally confussing, but the movie is still my fav.</p><hr><p><b>emberleo</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Toby the character isn't just *named after* Brian and Wendy Froud's son, Toby Froud played the baby! I think the changes between the original script and the movie are fascinating.</p><hr><p><b>ellie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is a classic, I am so into it. David Bowie is awesome as Jareth, such imagination.</p><hr><p><b>liely</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm so confused. I love this movie so much! But I really need the right script for my english speech and I can only find the "draft script" and it's making me angry! God I love this movie but this script, although not quite the same as the movie in all its greatness, is still very interesting.</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film too, it's tantalising now even though I'm seventeen. Mostly due to the fact David Bowie as King Jareth is so incredibly sexy. I know the first thing everyone says about him in Labyrinth is that his pants were too tight but I can't fail to feel a little shaky in the knees when he says 'What's said is said.' Oooh what an opening line. </p><hr><p><b>Justin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is amazing. To see the changes that have come about in the script since its inception to final production, and to understand some of the reasoning behind it. I'm glad it did change, as the original is just too much like "Wizard of Oz" and the final gives David Bowie so much more scope and depth.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The thing to remember is that this is not the final draft of the film but one of the earlier ones.</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>One of the great comedic masterpieces.  
My favorite part has to be the little worm with the english accent.  
"Did you say hello?"  
"Nah, I said Hallow!"
Jim Henson was the greatest.  
Although it's David Bowie who makes me laugh whenever I see it.  The costume is insane!  Why is his crotch all over the set of this children's film!  It's really a weird choice.
When Jareth turns into an owl at the end of the film I have expected it to have a giant bulging crotch as it flew toward the camera.</p><hr><p><b>Chelsea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like this script, it reminds me of me of how mellow dramatic I am, and how much my drama matters to me. If we ever made this movie, I hope to star in it because I think I can fit the character completely.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I haven't thought about this movie in years, I used to watch it when I was younger. Now I want to go out and rent or buy it and watch it again. What a great movie!</p><hr><p><b>raechal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This has some parts of the actual film in it but as it is a draft version it cannot be expected to relate entirely to the film. So if you are all finished complaining get the movie and write out what you think the actual script should be. However I still think the film is excellent and I have to say it surpassed my expectations.</p><hr><p><b>Darlene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Labyrinth is my favorite movie in the world and I wanted to find the script for a play in drama.</p><hr><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. Many people I talk to think there should be a Labyrinth 2 and I agree with them. It would be cool right?</p><hr><p><b>Kay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this movie rocks! David Bowie is definitely incredibly sexy. Mmmm. The first script for this movie was a bit raunchy isn't it?! Don't think it would have been a U.</p><hr><p><b>katie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watched it for the 1st time when I was in preschool and eight years later I am still in love with it. Sir didimous, pluto, david bowie, huggle everyone I feel as if I actually know them and the labyrinth is my life, I love it so much! I wish I could have met jim henson. He was my favorite director in the whole world and still is.</p><hr><p><b>Mattias</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If paradise was a movie, then it would be Labyrinth.</p><hr><p><b>Guinevere</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ahhh, this is a very early version of the script. Caryn is right; it's not the final version that was made into a movie. Still, it's an interesting read. Very odd to see how far the characters and the storyline had to come before final production. It's also quite interesting to see where the writers had originally intended to go with the film. It's basic goal is the same, but the way you get there is completely different.</p><hr><p><b>cassi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie still. I first saw it when I was 3 years old. And yes I also agree david bowie's pants were too tight. But it is amazing how Jim henson really brought the puppets to life and how each character was not the same as another. Ludo represented aside of Sarah, the more maybe strength in numbers, Didymus was the gallant and honorable, but hoggle was the most lovable. He really proved what a great and liable friend he was. Now, I own the vhs a dvd and anniverisery edition and I must say even in the commentary it stated about the ballroom scene "sarah made the mature decision and stopped leading him" you all know what that means. And I must say the film really deserved a sequal not in a book but in film, actors and lights. I WANT A SEQUAL.</p><hr><p><b>Lorelei</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was an incredible experience to read the "rough draft" version of this script! I have a copy of the novel, the video, and all of the DVD's, and had read a copy of the "final" script on the web, but had never read this until now. I am so very glad that they went with the other script! This one would have ruined everything! I, too want a sequel badly enough that I started writing one, taking upwhere they left offf, only 20 years later, and yes, they finally do become lovers, of a sort!</p><hr><p><b>Gabbs</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>It was good but I'm glad the movie turned out just a bit different. I like that Jareth is the slightest bit more likable in the movie. Love you David.</p><hr><p><b>Kelly Linley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like the final version, that made it to film. It shows Jareth to be less adolescent himself, less of a moody, whining teenager, for example at the end where he says why does this always happen to me etc. I think bowie is the perfect Jareth.</p><hr><p><b>Olivia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This the best movie in the world, in-fact I just finished watching it.</p><hr><p><b>Victoria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>So people know, this is the original script that Terry Jones wrote. The version you see in the movie was a joint effort by Jim Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. At least twenty-five treatments and scripts were drafted for Labyrinth between 1983–85, and the film's shooting script was only ready shortly before filming began.</p><hr><p><b>Bethany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For those of you who realise that this script is completely innacurate-it's a draft script- this was an original draft of Labyrinth, not the script that we knwtoday but one of the early drafts written by Henson & co.</p><hr><p><b>Esperanza</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely love discovering this after thirty years. The insight this draft provides is phenomenal for analysing! I hope Jim realizes how much this film continues to inspire & enchant. It's damn near perfect. This is not Jones' original draft as that one is all but lost to the world. His had, even through all the comedy, a focus that was not as inline with that of a teenage protagonist. It's such a divine happening so those involved in the film were present when they were to craft this masterpiece. I would love if the stage adaptation would come to fruition ;)</p><hr></td>
