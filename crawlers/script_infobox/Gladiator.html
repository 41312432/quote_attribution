Implausible twaddle! As if the Emperor of Rome would enter the arena to do combat with a slave - preposterous! 

</p><hr><p><b>biki</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Better than the best, 10/10.</p><hr><p><b>Roy1991</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Limey, it is known for a fact that Commodus fought in the arena against gladiators (though of course everything was arranged in such a way that he would win).</p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie. The acting was excellent, both by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. It was totally horrific to witness what actually happened to the gladiators (or anyone who stood in the Romans' way). All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Katrina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Joaquin Phoenix - a great actor for a great movie!</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Hey Limey, for your information, Emperor Commodus is known to have fought in the colliseum on several occasions. Suck on that!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Okay, so Commodus was known to have done combat with gladiators in the arena from time-to-time. Big deal! This was not exactly commonplace in almost seven centuries of hand-to-hand combat. In fact it's the only example of such unprecedented behaviour by an Emperor. He was always allowed to win, as a slave wouldn't dare to make a real go of it. And it's still a highly unrealistic event in this movie. How d'you like them apples? P.S: Did you do the research on that yourself or simply read Roy's posting from several months back?</p><hr><p><b>Sophie Dold</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Even though it wasn't commonplace, the fact that Commodus himself was known to fight in the arena makes this part of the story slightly more plausible.</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>While I wouldn't deny that there are plenty of historically dubious aspects to Gladiator, I think the film is enjoyable regardless of them, simply because it's a compelling story packed with action and spectacle. A bit like Casablanca the film just works in spite of its implausability. Also with Ridley Scott directing it looks stunning. Scott seems to be one of the few Hollywood directors who manages not to get carried away with CGI effects, but uses them with restraint so they genuinely enhance rather than overpower the picture. This gives Gladiator's action sequences a gritty authenticity, where all too many directors would have wound up making them look like a video game. All in all a spectacular epic movie. Just don't treat it as a history lesson.</p><hr><p><b>Jagdish</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Simply superb. My favourite movie.</p><hr><p><b>Abraham</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>When I see few comments that rate the movie down to the bottom what I feel is may be they need to come out of the shell and look at it as a movie rather than considering it as a historical review. History by itself is well known for its assumptions and presumptions. This movie is really a good treat to watch and Maximus is one of the best characters that the Hollywood has ever created. I have seen it more than ten times and still my passion for this movie is not yet over.</p><hr><p><b>Charlie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have seen this movie more times then I can remember, I have the soundtrack, costumes, I just love ancient Rome. I'm glad that other people out there love it too! Let's just hope that magically there is a sequel.</p><hr><p><b>Mick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Easily in my top 3 movies of all time. This film is spectacular. An epic in every sense of the word. People who complain about historical inaccuracies- why? It's a MOVIE. Ever heard of suspension of disbelief? The point of these films is to entertain people- "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!"- hell yes we are man.</p><hr><p><b>flashback67</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Having seen the movie dozens of times, it never ceases to amaze me. Anyone that does not like it is most likely offended by the blood/gore. If you get past that, it is truly a remarkable piece of work. I own the DVD and the soundtrack, I really feel that the music took this movie over the top of what it was.</p><hr><p><b>Kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I usually don't like films around that time period but this is one stood out to me. Everything about it was good, the actors played their parts well, the music took the action sequences to another level, and the ending was exceptable. Ain't nothing like seeing your'e emperor get killed by a GLADIATOR. (My Favorite Movie of All-Time so far).</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Crap film, highly implausible, thoroughly redeemed by a stunning peformance from Oliver Reed and a typically great performance by Derek Jacobi. But the film still only gets a three!</p><hr><p><b>Zeeshan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script is different that what you see in the movie, quite different.</p><hr><p><b>Turner</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie! I watched it 2 times in a row the first time someone let me borrow it.</p><hr><p><b>marwah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I liked the screenplay and also the directing of Ridley Scott is renowned for his historical movies.</p><hr><p><b>Alexis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love how everyone on here thinks the idea of the emperor fighting a gladiator is unfathomable. Historically, emperor Commodus DID fight a gladiator in the arena while he was emperor. He did not die from the fight but he did fight a gladiator in the arena. Also, the character of Maximus is based on a true person, much of which we do not know. Watch the documentary from the Special Edition before you knock the plot.</p><hr><p><b>Casper</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>To tell the truth, I'm a bit troubled that people rate movies only by its plausibility. What about the actors performance? Plausible or not, if the actor/ actress can bring reality to the "stage", then applaudable or not, the movie itself becomes real whatever the genre. Gladiator was one of the most impressive pieces of work that I've ever seen in my life! For all you critics, please do us all a favour and place the criticism where it should be, not on the "plausibility" of the script, but the reality that the actors bring to the stage!</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>How can you call a movie that won Best Picture and Best Actor bad? I understand that there were a few historical inaccuracies, but which movie doesn't have them? Oh well, the movie was amazing, the acting was amazing, and the end was EXCELLENT! I also have to say that anyone who thinks that this movie sucked should be forced to fight a trained fighter in gladiatorial combat, and be executed if they don't win.</p><hr><p><b>Ted</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Limey/alexis- forget the real world- this is the movie world.</p><hr><p><b>mohamed amine</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It's one of the most effecting movies in the history of movie making, its a story, a plot and a lesson we get from this movie. The artistic touch of Ridley Scott makes it a movie for generations. I advise everybody to watch it again and again.</p><hr><p><b>rockatansky</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Richard Roeper who said that in ten years we will look back and wonder what the hell we were doing giving this movie best picture.  The writers/director should have sacked up and been upfront about the fact that this was a retelling of Braveheart, a superior film, and just COPIED Braveheart's structure and beats.  Unfortunately, perhaps fearing the comparison, they changed too much and gutted their story.  This is basically a revenge movie that shies away from the elements that would make it emotionally gratifying.  Snot coming out of your nose while you're crying over your dead wife, doesn't make up for the fact that we never meet her in the film, and never see his (allegedly) great relationship with her. Telling is not showing. Just one complaint among many.  This is not a bad film, just a very disappointing one. </p><hr><p><b>gladiator</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A sci-fi doesn't need to be true in facts. The movie has a storyline that kept the audience glued, conflicts that made the audience have feelings towards the characters and music that ignites the role of the characters. Gladiator won best picture not because it copied Braveheart or any other movies (I mean, what kind of director would copy other movies? And you have Ridley Scott directing this movie), it won because it has its unique elements that tells the tale of the epic century of Rome and Braveheart is not about Rome. Face it, majority love the film, different people different taste but still, this movie has done well.</p><hr><p><b>dollymolly</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>For your info limey, Commodus fought in the arena without the slave going easy on him. He was an excellent fighter, with his personal trainer Narcissus training with him at least 6 times a week. In fact, when Commodus was in the arena, they would call on their best gladiators to give him a good opposition.</p><hr><p><b>DARWIN</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Undoubtebly one of the greatest films hollywood has ever produced. The film is very powerful, a rare and unique combination of an exellent acting, exellent plot, powerful drama, spectacular battle scenes and remarkeble special effects. This film is so toucheble, so heroic, so thrilling and entertaining as once, every time I see it is like the first time I saw it. Truly, one of the best films ever done. A true masterpiece and the best historical epic film ever done.</p><hr><p><b>gladiator fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie. Acting is great, plot is great, the scenerys are gorgeous, special effects are great  and the soundtrack (which I am listening right now) is also one of the best!

Joaquin Phoenix became my favorite actor after this movie. He should have got an Oscar too.

I agree with Zeeshan that this script draft is different from the one we see in the movie, for example the end where Commodus is killed by Maximus is completely different.</p><hr><p><b>Screenwriter90</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>All these silly comments about whether the script or the film followed historical fact - they are pointless. Concentrate on STORY, that's what screenplays are; that's what films are. In the final STORY as filmed and edited, Commodus isn't killing a mere slave, he is killing the former supreme general of the Roman Empire, his only serious rival for power and the replacement son of his own father. Films aren't history textbooks. I love the film, but it's too bad the script became such a committee undertaking.</p><hr><p><b>Darsoza</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The fact that people are disappointed about how inaccurate the movie is historically is by all means ridiculous and pointless. There are a lot of disbelief's and inaccuracies in history already.. then these people come along and criticize like they actually lived in the time of Commodus and fought with him. Maybe he fought and maybe not. Those are events written by men also and all men make mistake. This movie rocked house.. and definitely one of the best all time. 10 years from now it will be a classic. This is truly an epic.</p><hr><p><b>D1SCIPL3</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I think people should be rating the script, not the movie, but I loved the movie more than script, there's so much different, overall I give the script a 7 but the movie a 9.</p><hr><p><b>Tess</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I love Gladiator, and for what I read, the script is amazing as well. But what do you guys think of the script ending? It's COMPLETELY different from the ending of the movie, and I'm not sure whether I like it better or worse than the movie ending. I think the movie ending is a bit more poetic, but the script ending would've allowed a sequel to be made and is a lot less sad.</p><hr><p><b>James</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE this movie. My only real problem is the ending. Can you say anti-climactic? I understand that he was constantly trying to die from infection (that's why he kept tearing off his scab) but do they really have to have him being carried in? I mean, at least let him stand triumphant over Commodus before letting him die like that.</p><hr><p><b>the deranger</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so aspiring and makes my love for ancient Rome deeper. And Maximus portrayed by Russel Crowe is just so. I couldn't even find a word for it. Hah ha. It's my best movie of all time and Crowe's also my best actor of all time. A man like him, overwhelmed with peace whenever he talks or thinks of home is what the world today needs. And what's more? All he wanted most is to be a farmer and watch his children grow like the harvest of his field. I like everything about the movie. And mind you, I'm a history student and I like this movie because it's a movie not some stupid, boring history lesson.</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Limey- the movie's actually known as being one the most historically accurate portrayals of ancient Rome. Yes, some of it's wrong, but the vast majority is right. Commodus regularly fought in the arena against slaves. His death wasn't actually that different from the film. He was fighting slaves, daily, during the games. He didn't die in the arena, but he was killed by a servant, while in training for gladiator combat. You're in a hole. Please stop digging.</p><hr><p><b>nitesh</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>As I am watching movie. I don't see my favorite scenes written down. It must be director's choice then. As Maximus walking down the aisle of his men ready for war. Smiling at them, inspiring them with his warrior gaze and also the other when he bends to rub the soil against his palm and smell, looks at the dog and smiles.</p><hr><p><b>jeff adams</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>As Screenwriter90 above says: it's about the story not historical accuracy. In short, Hollywood "truth." An excellent movie.</p><hr></td>
