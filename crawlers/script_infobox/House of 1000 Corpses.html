    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Ryan O'Hara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Latest classic horror movie.  Rob Zombie's the man.  Not many horror movies are better.  Top 10 without question, up there with Romero's Zombie flicks, Texas Chainsaw, Freaks, The Funhouse, The Hills Have Eyes, Zombie, and of course The Devil's Rejects.  </p><hr><p><b>D. K. Ward</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I wish to be this good when my script is done!</p><hr><p><b>A. PARKER</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I  grew up watching horror movies - Halloween 1 & 2 my all time faves.  This was a little different than my usual horror tastes - thoroughly enjoyed it!  Devil's Rejects was really good, too - they are both on my list of favorite movies.</p><hr><p><b>kev biles</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best horror movies ever. Beats anything else out there and takes us away from the one person killer movie like the 80's gave us. Rob Zombie knows how to make a good film and a good script. It keeps you watching on the edge of your seat to find out what horror lurks around the next creepy corner.</p><hr><p><b>Melissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>House of a 1000 Corpses, definitely in my top 5 along with Devil's Rejects. Zombie knows his stuff. This is one of very few horror movies that can keep my attention stoned and not stoned. Always a fun experience watching House of a 1000 Corpses!</p><hr><p><b>James Harris</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>House of 1000 corpses is actually a rather good film. Which is more than I can say for it's second instilation (The devils rejects) which is painfully boring and extremely bad. House of a thousand corpses is nothing exactly new to the horror movie genre but that doesn't mean it don't deliver some truly scary scenes. It is a very simple story and reminds me a little of the highly disturbing 'wolf creek' and 'The texas chainsaw massacre'. If you just want to see a fairly good edge-of-your-seat slasher then this is the film for you. But I strongly suggest you don't waste your money on the second film.</p><hr><p><b>Erin</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I guess this is an early script - still a good read though. I love this film, a real horror fan's horror film.</p><hr><p><b>Doug</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I honestly don't think this script is very good. It clearly rips off dozens of old horror movie classics, including the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Most of the supposed scary scenes are extremely dumb and goofy. I will admit that there are many well crafted sequences, but the goofy ones definitely outweigh the good ones. The ending is terrible as well.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic film. Liked devil's rejects better though.</p><hr><p><b>Tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am the BIGGEST House of 1000 Corpses Fan that there is, it is the most incredible movie and I am obsessed with it.</p><hr><p><b>frog</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Corpses was raw, the manner that the video was edited was very. I missed that in Rejects. Although the characters were very interesting.</p><hr><p><b>Rob Hollywood</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie sucked, so did devil's rejects. Rob should stick to music and stay away from the horror genre. I'd rather see the hills have eyes which was also crap. Or if they paid me i'd sit there and watch wolf's creek. Sorry Rob. Big fan of your music, not a big fan of your films which were blatant rip offs of Chainsaw and a few others.</p><hr><p><b>James Bond</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film is very punk!</p><hr><p><b>Jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really liked these films even though I'm 15 I would say both films blow wolfcreek or whatever it's called out of the water. I also grew up watching
Wes Craven's films from people under the stairs to the scream series. So what I say to Rob is keep up the good work your films kick ass.</p><hr><p><b>Ebony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm 13 and love the movie house of 1000 corpses. It's my favorite movie of all time and all my friends are too scared to watch it! But they're wimps. I love movies with blood and gore. Can't wait for the next rob zombie film! My favourite character is baby, she's so pretty. Rob kicks ass.</p><hr><p><b>Carmella Firefly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Rob Zombie bought us to life. The fireflys outdo any horror family. Ask my daddy Spaulding. The script is pretty accurate, to the point, and brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>StarBurst</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>House of 1000 corpses is the best movie hands down. No one can do what Rob Zombie did. I just wish there were more movies like that. Favorite QUOTE- "Why", you ask? "Why" is not the question... How? Now, that is a question worth examining. How could I, being born of such, uh. Conventional stock, arrive a leader of the rebellion? An escapist from a conformist world, destined to find happiness only in that which cannot be explained? I brought you here for a reason, but unfortunately you and your sentimental minds are doing me no good. My brain is frozen. Locked. I have to break free from this culture of mechanical reproductions and the thick encrustations dying on the surface. Quote 2- Boy, the next word that comes out of your mouth better be some brilliant Mark Twain shit. 'Cause it's definitely getting chiseled on your tombstone.</p><hr><p><b>sailormoon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the greatest movies of all time. One question may seem stupid, who is baby dressing up as, when she performs for the dinner guests?</p><hr><p><b>Dominic</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>If you cant see that this is one of the best horror movies ever written you probably just don't like horror, will the moron who rated this movie one out of 10 please respond with what his favorite horror movie is please? If you can't appreciate Rob's style of horror go back to watching garbage such as the ring 2 or the newest saw maybe. Rob's crap has more creative high points than anything Doug could ever write or even dream! I think a 9 out of 10 sums this up pretty fair don't you?</p><hr><p><b>Zombie Shack9</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>People who like this movie are high on crack.  This film sucked!  Zombie just tossed a bunch of ripped-off, horror movie leftovers in a pot, stirred it, ate it and then diarrhea'ed  it back onto paper.  Total garbage derived from a dozen other, better movies.  It took a number of years, rewrites and re-shoots to even make it watchable.  It sucked so bad the original studio dropped it, not understanding that the world is full of tasteless morons as duly demonstrated here.

Add to all that bad acting, especially Rob's girlfriend / wife who's acting sucked and further spoiled the movie like cat pee on a nice couch.

Anybody can do what Zombie did, just nobody else would want to. If anyone other than Zombie had written the exact same movie, it never would have seen the light of day.</p><hr><p><b>Mai</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>(To Zombie Shack9) Well than I reckon I must as high as a kite, because this movie is a great one. The actors and actresses are fantastic, the plot is awesome, the blood and violence, it's almost arousing. I've seen this and The Devil's Rejects over 150 times each. I know both movies word by word. Just because it was written by Rob Zombie don't mean that's the only reason  like it "You asshole!"    </p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If I can add a simple and stupid comment which I normally hate, those of you criticizing this movie have no idea what you are talking about. One of my favorites and honestly a movie that I can't understand any horror movie fan not loving. Harkening back to a just old school horror movie, it is simultaneously a ode to those which have come before if while offering a new and original perspective in both the script and in the cinemagraphic style and overall vision of the movie. Great movie, and the sequel is equally as good in a totally different way.</p><hr><p><b>bonnie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I watched this film when I was 14, I'm now 20 and think about it frequently. I can safely say I've seen my fair share of horror films but this one has left me deeply disturbed to my very core. The film may have been compared to chainsaw massacre and others because the outlaying plot is similar but the actual premise of the film is utterly unique to what I've ever watched before and a film that can haunt me for that long must be good, so well done rob zombie.</p><hr><p><b>confused</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I'm a little confused about this script, I have seen this movie a thousand times and the script I just read is incredibly different. I REALLY love this movie but what is this script.</p><hr><p><b>Tiffany S.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>House of 1000 corpses is a brilliant movie, and yes I watch it to raise my spirits when I am depressed! I was reading the script to see what the tape recorder says as they are being lowered into Dr. Satan's den. Sounds like" bury me in a shallow grave, I came from god the one who made me" but this could be way off. Does anyone know?</p><hr><p><b>rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was bury me in the nameless grave, but I don't know.</p><hr><p><b>Flugrat-209</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie sucks so incredibly bad. A total steaming turd. Thanks "Zombie Shack9" you perfectly stated what I was going to say. Rob Zombie's goofy wife was the absolute worst performer in the movie. Her performance cast an indelible stench on this movie like cat pee does to a couch. However, I do think it is better that you HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CORPSES fans watch this movie instead of your hobby of capturing insects and small animals, pulling their limbs off and torturing them. As one commenter said, "it's almost arousing" and that they watched it "over 150 times" and that they "know (it) word for word" as if that were some kind of endorsement versus the rantings of a serial killer.</p><hr><p><b>Kristina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love horror movies. Nightmare on Elm street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Evil Dead, The night of the living dead (original), but Rob Zombie has a twisted outlook on everything. It's so beautiful in a twisted kind of way. He makes you root for the bad guy, if you know what I mean, and you do if you watched Devils Rejects. Rob is a twisted genius. Want to see something new and original? Watch any movie that Rob makes. He will make an old movie new again. Thanks to Rob and Sherri Zombie for the great movies.. and thanks to Rob for sharing Sherri with all of us fans, she is so hot.</p><hr><p><b>Klaus Pingle</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Few films are as big of a rip-off of good films and yet achieves nothing more than being a piece of excrement as this film. If it wasn't written by Rob Zombie this movie would have never been a studio picture. Never. Hey Hollywood. Give some real story tellers a chance.</p><hr><p><b>KristinaL</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>House of 1000 corpses, Devils Rejects, both Halloween remakes. I love them all. Rob Zombie is a twisted genius. He some how makes you sympathize with the "villain" and before the end of the movie you're always rooting for everything to work out in favor of the bad guy. Music and movies, keep up the good work, you keep the world entertained.</p><hr><p><b>cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The failed robbery attempt at the beginning, the kick ass opening credits, the scarecrow scene in the middle, and the last 15 and a half minutes were awesome, but the movie wasn't gory enough, and after the failed robbery attempt at the beginning, it does take a while to get to the mayhem, but after the scarecrow scene, the second half became awesome, but I will say that the self titled song is several times better.</p><hr></td>
