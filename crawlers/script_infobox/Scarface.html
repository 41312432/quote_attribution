PERIOD.</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>excellent</p><hr><p><b>zack</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>say hellow to my little friend.</p><hr><p><b>tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>278 swears!!!</p><hr><p><b>Tony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>my favorite movie and he has my name except for the last one</p><hr><p><b>Stephanie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie!  Superb acting by superb cast! My favorite movie of ALL TIME! Al Pacino is amazing as Tony Montana.</p><hr><p><b>Greyson Futrell</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the 1980's guilty pleasure, from the clothes they wear to the music the listen to, it gets it right. Al Pacino delivers an excellent performance as the one and only Tony Montana. Being nearly perfect the movie lags in two spots: 
1. Sometimes obnoxious acting by other members of the cast and 2. A cheesy montage I could have went without.</p><hr><p><b>Cj</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Me and my boys watch this movie every time we blow on some dro and it never gets old. Scarface was real.</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I needed to see a doctor after this movie, it was messed up! It traumatised me.</p><hr><p><b>jose sajir e</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yeah best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>killer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Man this movie is so real each time I watch it I become Tony Montana. I wish they had made a second part to this movie. THE WORLD IS MINE AND EVERYTHING IN IT.</p><hr><p><b>Lovely_Bee</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie is great. One of the best gangsta movies around. But this movie script needs a touch-up! Like I'm watching the movie while reading and there are so many wrong words. My favorite quote is "Who do I trust? Me, that's who!".</p><hr><p><b>daria, marte and tuva</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>We love this film it's the best. Tony Montana is in our hearts forever. He's the only real gangsta that ever lived.</p><hr><p><b>J.D</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is the greatest movie ever!</p><hr><p><b>Sparky</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>To all of you who loved the movie, just wanted to inform you this is not a real story. This movie was a remake of the Original one done in 1932 directed by Howard Hwaks. Therefore there is no Cuban named Tony Montana, that was real. Wake up everybody.</p><hr><p><b>kresto</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A masterpiece! One of the best films, this is real art.</p><hr><p><b>Christian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved it, the film revolutionised movie history forever. No man alive could have played the Cuban refugee Antonio Montana like Al Pacino did. I think it should have got at least 11 oscars, including best actor, screenplay and best supporting actress. It is the greatest of all movies and always will be.</p><hr><p><b>Lila</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is the best movie ever! I watched it twice today and I love it! He swears so much in it but it's friggen awesome!</p><hr><p><b>dude</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Somebody please get this guy an editor.</p><hr><p><b>Jose</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Probably one of the best Al Pacino movies ever made!</p><hr><p><b>Punch Your Face</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Why do you have to smoke pot to watch scarface? And for that matter, why are rappers obsessed with this movie? They act so damn retarded when they talk about it. It was too long anyway.</p><hr><p><b>bryan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface kicks major ass, the best movie ever made.</p><hr><p><b>Koky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie Is one of the best of all time and if I were to pick one movie to watch for the rest of my life it would be Scarface.</p><hr><p><b>Tony Montana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is the best movie ever. Any of you punks out there who think it sucks, you can burn. Tony Montana will come back from the dead and go back to the top. Just like before.</p><hr><p><b>al pacino</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie I ever played in.</p><hr><p><b>Scarface</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You f*** with me you're f***ing with the best.</p><hr><p><b>chi chi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is the best movie ever made. If you don't agree then you will have to say 'ello to my lil friend!</p><hr><p><b>geof goldstein</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Not as good as the original movie with Paul Muni, and Howard Hawks .
5 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>Sosa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THE BEST MOVIE EVER !

The acting, props, setting and scripting is perfect. Undoubtedly the most memorable movie of all time.</p><hr><p><b>Brian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's one of my top 3 films of all time. It kicks balls.</p><hr><p><b>Timbo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is by far the best movie ever made. The movie gives people that are having hard times in life, hope for a better future. Seeing tony montana go from rags to riches a the biggest inspiration to people all over the world, without a doubt 10 star movie!</p><hr><p><b>nicka</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. But this script is completely different to the actual movie.</p><hr><p><b>Aris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the thing. The sad part is that most probably we won't see movies like this coming out in the future. Antonio Montana forever.</p><hr><p><b>pajaro muerto</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>By far this is the best role al pacino has ever played, I've lived every day just like him. Tony much props and respect.</p><hr><p><b>Fawad Akhtari</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am Fawad from Afghanistan and I live here currently. When I first saw this movie, I felt like most of Indian crime movies are copied from this. I love Al Pacino for his style and acting. He is one of my favorite actors. Tom Hanks is also one of the actors sinked in the movies / acting world. The language used in this movie is somehow excellent for a movie.</p><hr><p><b>Jesse Taylot</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hands down this movie is a masterpiece. Can't wait for the HD version to come out. Also I was watching the bonus disc from the anniversary version and the amount of depth and detail that the whole crew went into just makes me love this movie even more.</p><hr><p><b>ginsu</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite gangster screenplay over the Godfather films. The writing on this film is amazing on so many levels. It's too bad the text scan here has so many formatting troubles. You'd think that IMSDB would take a minute to clean it up a bit- it's very hard to read.</p><hr><p><b>Manan</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>When I was 15 I loved this movie. Now it just seems so silly and laughable. If it is "real", then so is Bugs Bunny. No wonder these idiot 'gangsta' rappers like it so much. They have zero knowledge of what's real and what's not. There are much "realer" gangster movies out there. Heck, there's even a TV series (or was, until very recently) that's way more real. Who would you not want to mess around with - Tony Soprano or Tony Montana?</p><hr><p><b>Petrovski</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A shown detailed masterpiece of the South American drug cartel with local world history. Great Film "Say hello to my Favorite Script!" (PRINT)</p><hr><p><b>Tina</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>First thing I have to say about this film; it was horribly unrealistic and full of gratuitious violence and vituperation, that it almost made me fall asleep.

Secondly, why would such Al Pacino, an actor with so much charisma want to accept a role in such a banal film?

The last thing I have to say is about the last scene of the film, I almost laughed to death when Tony so-called "Scarface" Montana got shot by those ruffian gangsters (why would so many people want to be gangsters anyways), the gun shots had apparently been run over by rotoscoping and who would lose so much blood when the got shot?

If the real Scarface (Al Capone, mind you) saw this film when it came out, I bet he'll want to get his gang and murder Brian del Palma and Oliver Stone in their beds, it would serve them some right.</p><hr><p><b>John</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Michelle makes it clear by manipulating today's three drugs in her hands; cigarettes, alcohol and drugs - simple, yet affective directing. Al is the epitome of refugee cum hedonistic cum false god and to go down in his own demise. Once again, excellent directing, production and mostly acting. </p><hr><p><b>shane</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is my most favorite movie, and I don't know why someone would say things like, unrealistic. It was made YEARS ago, and of course the special effects and gunshots would have been less realistic then today's era. Every scene of the movie played a part for the ending to wrap up the story. It was simple. He !@#$% up. That's how he got to were his life ended. That and cocaine. Lots, and lots of cocaine. The exceptions were reasonable, and the plot was genius.</p><hr><p><b>Rosie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scarface is one of the best films ever made. The acting is just superb. I can't imagine anyone else playing Tony Montana. Al Pacino is a truly a brilliant actor. I have an obsession with Al Pacino films because he is so good. I annoy my friends by constantly talking about it. Not many people my age have even heard of Al Pacino. I'm 14, so most people watch new films, yet I watch old crime and mafia films. It just fascinates me. Anyway, brilliant film. Can't beat it. I got the video game and I'm playing it constantly, even though I am shit at it. My Favourite quote has to be: "Who do I trust? Me, that's who!".</p><hr><p><b>cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I can't wait to watch this during mob week, it'll be awesome, and the mansion shootout at the end is the best scene in the movie, SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND.</p><hr><p><b>cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was awesome, it had a lot of cool moments, cool music, and craziness, and the mansion shootout is my favorite scene in the whole movie, SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND.</p><hr><p><b>facescared</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yeah we all know Scarface was a MASTERPIECE. Al Pacino is AWESOME! I hope to write a screenplay to bring authenticity back to hollywood.</p><hr><p><b>Lou</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Like most people commented: 'the best movie ever", and I agree. I read the script and noticed some lines were missing from Tony's scene where he is being interrogated by the agents during the beginning scenes: "where did you get the beauty mark? From eating pussy?" and tony has a reply for the agent.</p><hr><p><b>GuccizBud</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"In May 1900, Fidel Castro- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration - opened the harbor at Mariel". Should be "1980", not "1900".</p><hr><p><b>Jon Stevens Alon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is Oliver Stone. When you read a few lines of his writing you know you're in the hands of a KING. Platoon, Salvador, Scarface, products of a genius mind.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've always liked scarface better than the godfather due to the fact that it's faster paced and has funny moments in it, it also influenced the hip hop and rap genres and was the basis for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, how can you top that?, and I couldn't picture anybody else playing tony Montana, only AL Pacino could do it and his performance was amazing.</p><hr><p><b>Luis</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This movie sucks, and it has non-Latin American actors portraying horrible stereotypes that I believe have set back Latin American actors from reaching dignified roles. No surprise, since it was written and made by white people. Say hello to my lack of representation.</p><hr></td>
