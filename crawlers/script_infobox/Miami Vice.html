    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Samuel</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Hope I break It one day. Great art piece.</p><hr><p><b>harry georgatos</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>When I walked into the cinema to watch Michael Mann's "Miami Vice" I expected an event picture to what I consider to be his greatest achievement on film "Heat". Even though "Miami Vice" has spectacular digital photography this movie is basicaly a formula driven narrative that can come out of an episode of the tv series. I still had a good time watching 'Miami Vice" on a neo-noir pulp level of entertainment. One gets the feeling Michael Mann was doing a job for hire with this film and his heart was not in it. One still has to respect the technique and craftsmanship behind the making of this film. I'm eager to see what this director is going to do next.</p><hr><p><b>Trey</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I actually thought this movie was horrible. It was really confusing. It was all over the place. M Mann what happened?</p><hr><p><b>Doc Block</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Definately not Mann's best film or screenplay. But I still enjoyed it for what it was- Mann is a true craftsman and when he strikes the target he can really make a film ice cold hot!</p><hr><p><b>Solo</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow. Mann plunges you neck deep immediately in this world of undercover Miami and panders to no one, as usual. He does more with a single quiet shot than anybody. His use of color is amazing in this film. It is a difficult to follow picture, but that's intentional. If you really want to come along for the ride, then here it is. If you get lost along the way a little, it's because you should. If you don't have the attention span to ride along, then so be it.</p><hr><p><b>Gus</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Michael Mann is a highly accurate director when it comes up to crime movies, from one character to another Mann is able to have each of them apply actual technique Law enforcement and Cartels uses.</p><hr><p><b>Andre Rehal</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I really love Michael Mann, and I have to say I was disappointed with this film. As a follow up to Collateral I was interested in seeing what he would do with a mostly digital feature. It retained a distinct look, but I think it was the story that made the film fall apart. There was too much going on, I get that he wanted to show the bigger picture, but if the majority of the story stayed in Miami, then I think the focus would have been there, look at Heat and Collateral, they were both focused within LA, it made for a better movie. I also think that casting hurt the overall product. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell had zero chemistry with one another, they really didn't seem like best friends cops at all to me, but hey this is all my opinion. Still looking forward to Michael Mann's next project.</p><hr><p><b>Rene</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed reading the script. Well written, intriguing and hard to put down. I hope I learn to write this well someday. Thank you for sharing.</p><hr><p><b>Captain</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What a superb piece or work by Mr Mann. My wife and I ended up buying the movie and have watched it several times. The attention to detail, the filming, music, ambiance in general are incredible. The excellent out-takes provide intriguing insight into the making of this film. Mr Mann: When can we have Miami Vice 2?</p><hr><p><b>Vic Almeida</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Details, crafted with perfection. Preparation, research, great actors.
Interesting plots, no visual effects. Actors like to work with him. You don't get Deniro and Pacino together unless you are one of the best. The only drawback.. no quantity. We need more movies from Mann. Perfection would be Michael Moore and Mann together to come up with a  film about the CIA, Cheney and who really runs this great country. A 1/2 documentary, 1/2 fiction.</p><hr><p><b>vincent</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Actually I liked the movie more than the script. But I love the amazing attention to all the tiny details one could think that Michael Mann is financing his movies by smuggling powder to the US ;-) Funny however that "gringos" don't know to distinguish "samba" from "salsa" (what they are actually dancing in the movie).</p><hr><p><b>Neal MacCauley</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>In response to Harry Georgatos comments:

How can you say seriously that Mann was a "Job for hire" on this movie and "his heart wasn't in it"?

He was Exec Producer on 111 episodes of the TV series, wrote & directed the film version over twenty years later. How much more interested would you like him to be?

I hated this movie the first time I saw it! I didn't get it! It wasn't Heat! After repeat viewings on DVD, this is an awesome movie and quite possibly Manns most personal work to date after Heat. 

The problem is that you don't get that character set up. You are given two friends that don't communicate - They don't have to, it's instinct. They know each other, trust each other implicitly. They deal with it and so must the viewer. That is Manns genius - He gives you the real world and all it's warts and doesn't feel the need to tell you how it ended up that way!</p><hr><p><b>Ken</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am not sure what some people want? I thought the movie was everything it should have been. The cinematography was amazing as were the locations. I do not agree with the reviewer that thought the movie was confusing and all over the place. I think the multiple locations really added o the whole of the concept. I think the casting was spot on, Jamie and Collin were excellent together. They had the look and the swagger of the original cast. Mann paid so much attention to the locations, every shot was perfect. I hope there is a sequel.</p><hr><p><b>Gary C</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The first time I saw this I was lost. After watching the DVD version, I got it! The DVD cut is much better than the theatrical version.</p><hr><p><b>David Starks</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was REALLY horrible. I tried watching it several times, but just couldn't stomach past the first 30 minutes. The cinematography (if you want to call it that) was atrocious. Come on Michael Mann, where did you go. I used to love your movies. Now, they all look like a big steaming pile of crap. Learn how to shoot digital if you're going to shoot with it. As far as the story, sorry didn't get that far because it looked soooo BAD.</p><hr><p><b>Mars</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A beautiful piece of writing, with Mann's usual attention to detail, even on the page. This version is more light-hearted than what ended up being made, but a lot of the romance is there and far more compelling in the actual film. Luckily, it's not just a two hour modernized episode of the show, it's a more abstract and poetic film. I wish MM would write more of his own films, without co-writers, and not have to mediate his endlessly creative film form with that of a traditional screenplay.</p><hr><p><b>Greg</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This was the best acting in a love story I've seen in ages. I kind of wished this movie was only a love story and we forgot about all the other stuff.</p><hr></td>
