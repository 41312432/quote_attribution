It's a simple but powerful presentation of a story.</p><hr><p><b>Christian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film inspired me to take up boxing, it gave me brain damage but who gives a shit.</p><hr><p><b>Jade</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I've been a fan of the entire Rocky series since I was nine, but I like this one the most out of all the films in the Rocky series.</p><hr><p><b>rutger</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Last week I bought the Rocky Collection Box, especially the first Rocky is a gift from heaven.</p><hr><p><b>rocky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this is the best movie since movies begun to film. I watch them on tv a thousand times and now I'm collecting money for the Rocky Collection Box. My real name is Rocky so this is really cool.</p><hr><p><b>Guy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>An amazing script that is just as good reading as it is watching in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ivan Drago must die for what he did to Apollo. RIP Apollo.</p><hr><p><b>Dana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm in love with Rocky. The story is brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Allexx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am absolutely IN LOVE with Rocky! Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I'm a girl and I like Rocky. It's just amazing. And if any girls or anyone for that matter are reading this and think Rocky is stupid and only for guys BOY ARE YOU FREAKEN WRONG! As soon as I heard that the 6th rocky was coming out I was ecstatic! I couldn't believe it. And am however depressed that this time for real that was the last Rocky movie of all the series. I just wish that Sly would never get old and keep making these movies. Or that maybe he can train his son or something to become another "Rocky"? But what can I say, it won't be the same without Sly. Without him I probably wouldn't be able to get into the movie. And even without all the other characters Rocky wouldn't be the same. I think that the order of the movies from best to "good" (since none of them are HORRIBLE or BAD!) are: 1. 2. 4. 6. 3. 5! The only criticism I have is that I think the 3rd and the 5th one weren't one of the GREATEST rocky films but it's okay since the 6th one "rocky balboa" makes up for it! All in all. The ROCKY SERIES IS BY FAR THE BEST SERIES IN MOVIE HISTORY! And I can guarantee you that NO MOVIE I repeat NO MOIVE will ever replace the Rocky series. 10 OUT OF 10 STARS HANDS DOWN! I love rocky!</p><hr><p><b>anon.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing. 3 and 4 are better though!</p><hr><p><b>Arjun</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sylvester Stallone is a fantastic story writer. The characters he has created show his understanding of the human psyche and the kind of person he himself is. Rocky is in a way Stallone and vice versa. I wish Sylvester Stallone all the best and I thank him for giving us one of the greatest movie characters of all time.</p><hr><p><b>marty bueller</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. My favorite Rocky movies are Rocky 1, Rocky Balboa, Rocky 2, Rocky 3, Rocky 4. The one that I like the least is Rocky 5, it stunk. There are some mistakes in this script. The guy who fought Rocky at the beginning's name is spider rico not spider rice, and spider rico is white not black. Fact: what made sly come up with Rocky is sly saw the  muhammad ali vs chuck wepner fight. He was so impressed by wepner that he came up with Rocky.</p><hr><p><b>The Engineer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Greatest movie ever. Has a deeper meaning then just boxing. But about doing your best even when the odds are against you.</p><hr><p><b>Kevin Lee</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>As far as I know that's not the finished script. Since when was Rocky's face scarred??

But yeah. Amazing film. One of the best ever, and Sly is a great actor, writer, and director. I don't care what anyone says. </p><hr><p><b>VINNIE</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I was only nine years old when I saw the first ROCKY movie that was made. I was in awe way back then and over thirty years later it is still the best movie I have ever seen. YO ROCKY! You are a KNOCKOUT!</p><hr><p><b>Kenya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am so Rocky obsessed, I'm almost always watching them. When I first saw Rocky I just wanted to reach out and hug him, I felt so sorry that people were calling him a Bum ... it was mean. I know you probably think this is weird but I sleep with all the Rocky movies next to my Pillow. I can't go anywhere without them not only because I think they bring me luck but because it's an amazing story and it stops me from being bored. I was so Happy !!! when the sixth one came out I ran down my street and screamed, but then I was also really sad because that was the complete ending but it wouldn't be good if they replaced them with other younger actors. P.S ... Talia Shire just in case you're reading this, I think you're the best thing that ever came from Italy 8D - you're good too Sly but Sage Stallone sucks because he passed up the opportunity to be in the last Rocky.</p><hr><p><b>nivi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Rocky is one of the most inspiring movies ever made. I am a die-hard fan of underdog stories and this one is my favorite. Besides Sly's brilliant performance, Talia Shire, Burt young, Burgess Meredith and Carl Weathers have also done an excellent job. Whenever I feel slack,loose my confidence and feel unnoticed, I used to watch this movie which cheers me up a lot and makes me feel better. I grew up in a place where this movie hasn't any value and everyone thinks it's just a sport movie. But I don't care and ignore their ridiculous comments. For me more than boxing, Rocky is a very classy movie. No wonder it had won 2 oscars. Sylvester Stallone (my hero) rocks.</p><hr><p><b>paulieandthemeat</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sylvester Stallone is a legend. Rocky is a timeless piece of work that will never be anything short of amazing. Classic collection and I look forward to Stallone's upcoming film.  P.S. YO ADRIAN!!</p><hr><p><b>sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've been wanting to see the rocky series for a while now, luckily someone picked up on this and got me the set for a birthday present. THE best birthday present EVER! What an experience it is to watch such an inspirational man in action. If only there could be more! An absolute legend in my eyes. Legendary.</p><hr><p><b>JSawyer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>1-2-4-5-3-6. Everyone hates me for this but 6 was a big let-down for me. I don't get why everyone hates on 5 but just LOVES the new one. It isn't a believable story. We can sort of say that about all of them, but a 50-something year old man can't do that. The original 2 are by far the best! 4 is just plain fun, 5 takes the story down a new and realistic route while showcasing his street side, and 3 has some script issues, but is still decent enough. Though, any way you want to look at it, these movies are one of the best and will continue to be one of the best series' of all time.</p><hr><p><b>Hal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think Rocky is one of the most inspired stories of the twentieth century. There are a lot of great movies out there, but few have the quality of myth that Rocky has. It's one of those stories that feels as if its been drawn straight from the collective human psyche- like Cinderella or Frankenstein. Stallone had a genuine moment of genius when he wrote it. It's a shame about the sequels, really. They're all good films in their own right, but I feel they undermine the poetic tone and spirit of the original.</p><hr><p><b>Bill</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Rocky's opponent at the beginning of the movie was originally named Spider Rice (it's consistently spelled that way rather than as Spider Rico in the companion book) but changed to make him a Hispanic fighter (Spider Rico) rather than a black one when boxer Pedro Lovell was cast in the role.</p><hr><p><b>Joe C. </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Rocky is, and will always be a story of the true meaning of the (underdog). The human spirit is a great thing and wish more movies these days can capture that. No matter what adversities I come across I always love watching the Rocky series, it's a true motivator! Thanks Rock.</p><hr><p><b>Ross Logan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply the best script ever written and the best movie ever made. Pure genious.</p><hr><p><b>Peter </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My friend Jimmy Gambina who is in the first Rocky helped Stallone fine tune the script and train him.</p><hr><p><b>Cayman Bolles</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that the Rocky series is fantastic and should be animated.</p><hr><p><b>Hayden</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Reading this script has inspired me to begin writing scripts of my own. Learning that Sylvester Stallone wrote this script himself, makes me feel much more confident in doing what I've always wanted to do. Personally, I can't get over the Rocky films. They're so exciting to watch and are very motivating. Whenever I feel down, these movies won't fail bringing me back on my feet. If I had to pick one word to describe these films, I would say it was (and still is) astonishing.</p><hr></td>
