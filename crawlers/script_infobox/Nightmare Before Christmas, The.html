My particular favourite is Jack, he is so cool!
It's like a fairytale gone wrong, with a twisted gothic theme, excellent production!</p><hr><p><b>JJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my all time favorite Holloween and Christmas film! Jack and Sally are so real to me.  I have loved the movei sience well i cant even rember when.  It inspired me to use my imagnation when I was younger and it still dose today.  I love Zero he is a great companion for an lonely skelton.  Sally and Jack were the greatest part of the movie and I love the way they end up together.  It is A fairytale that went horribly wrong.  Lock, Shock and Barrel are the best minions for Oggie Boogie.  It is the best cartoon, gothic,christmas,halloween movie ever!! (Not to mention the ony only one)</p><hr><p><b>Nikki</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"Nightmare before Chirstmas" is my all time favorite movie since i was 4 years old. I love Jack and Zero. I always watched that movie many times. And tell you what, i heard that a playsation 2 new game of "Nightmare before Chirstmas Oogie's Revenage." it will relaease in North America in fall 2006</p><hr><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Allison</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is such a good movie.  Something about just captures you. I LOVE the music and the voices!!   10</p><hr><p><b>Eric King</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is absoulte potty. I mean honestly I get the fealing most of these children just like the movie because their friends do. Sad when you think about it,now onto buisness. This story is NOT gothic. I despise it when people label anything, espiecly a movie this amazing. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a prime example of a well written musical. The tunes are catchy, fresh, and never boring. Unfortunetly Burton's recent stop motion film "The Corpse Bride" was not as well done, lacking all of the quality's that makes Nightmare so increadable. The score by Danny Elfman is absolutely amazing, and perhaps is greatest work to date. The story is masterfully directed and acted. Go and and get this on DVD if you haven't allready.</p><hr><p><b>Carly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best films of all time! I loved it when i was younger and i love it even more now. Jack is my hero, if i could steal christmas, i'd do it to!</p><hr><p><b>Aliceia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love it I love it I love it!!!! your Soooo cool I love it so! yay!</p><hr><p><b>tooo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>:D i love it!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Qubeley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's just an amazingly extraordinary film of all time!  YES, IT'S DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE! It masters everything that this type of movie could've ever master!  The arrangements of everything, the tone, the music, the story, the layout, the characters, even the smallest things, they're just like touching your heart!  Every time you watch it you feel something new, and the music rings in your head after months!  The whole production is so good, that I won't forgot the script after seen it only once!  What a masterful production!  I love you Jack!</p><hr><p><b>Missy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie : ) </p><hr><p><b>Craig Mayle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie couldn't be better! It is "old school" Tim Burton, and I wish he would do more like this.</p><hr><p><b>Janet Chen</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This is the most amazing animation movie that I've ever seen. The music and scenes in the flim are great.I recommand this movie to anyone  who likes animation movies.Enjoy it!</p><hr><p><b>pip</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the best film ever made i love all of tim burtons film but this is the best.</p><hr><p><b>Daniel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the best film ever! i love it! everytime i watch it i feel instantly better, thank you mr burton x</p><hr><p><b>Erika</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>the nightmare before christmas is the best. i am doing a report on it for my computer class. i watch it alot. it is the best movie.</p><hr><p><b>Courtney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever. I've loved the nightmare before christmas since I was a kid. Oogie Boogie is the best, he's so cool, and his song is the best out of all of them I think .. well beside the scheming song that ones pretty cool. Nightmare Before Christmas is the best movie ever!!</p><hr><p><b>tik</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Perfect!</p><hr><p><b>Pyro Skrewl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best freakin' movie on earth! Jack Skellington is my 5th hero. Corpse Bride came really really close but not much beats Jack!</p><hr><p><b>lydia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever! Anyone who doesn't like it must not have seen it. I love it so!</p><hr><p><b>Xander</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie EVER in my opinion. No other movie has ever lived up to it's reputation. If they make a second I can't wait for it!</p><hr><p><b>grant age 12</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Go Jack go Jack, I love Jack (also featured in kingdom hearts game for ps2 which also has a great movie soundtrack). The nightmare before christmas was a real classic. It had great animation and music and Jack and lots of great things no other movie could bring to the screen.</p><hr><p><b>sophie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jack is brilliant. This is the best film I've ever seen, who'd give it less than 10?!</p><hr><p><b>ElRojo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great. Just great. One of Burton's best movies!</p><hr><p><b>william</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, especially the music. I watch it all the time.</p><hr><p><b>Vampire Jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks, I don't care what anyone says. Long live Jack Skelington!</p><hr><p><b>FrostyBehindu</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I'd rather have my nails ripped off one by one while being roasted over an open fire. I dont know how anyone can like it. I'd give it -1 if I could.</p><hr><p><b>Taylorr</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Iria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No matter how young you were when you first watched it, ten years later you still love it with the same intensity. Possibly Burton's best movie. Un chef-d'oeuvre!</p><hr><p><b>Cheyenne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE Tim Burton. You simply CAN'T turn one of his movies down!</p><hr><p><b>Victor</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It was OK but Corpse Bride is better, especially because it has me in it :). I give it a 7, it creeped me OUT! Oh, sorry Cheyanne. I just HAD to not give it a 10. I mean really, don't you like ME better then Jack Skelington?</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is amazing. NBC is hands down the best movie ever created, I have loved it ever since I was a a wee little child. You have done some amazing work and I would like to say good job :) Anyways best movie ever, there's no movie that compares to this.</p><hr><p><b>Angie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! I always will.</p><hr><p><b>Secret101</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have loved this movie since I was a baby, 13 years later I still am in love with it!</p><hr><p><b>Chelsea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I totally love this movie! How could you not?</p><hr><p><b>patrick lee turner</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever!</p><hr><p><b>Fleur Delacour's Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a great movie! I love the three little kids-Lock, Shock and Barrel-they're awesome.</p><hr><p><b>anno</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best animation movie ever! I'm so addicted to the songs, I love this movie. Great story, great music, great animation, everything is fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>Meng Hon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is very nice. Actually, I have not seen this movie before and I am watching it a few days later but, I had watched the trailer before. It's nice and the song is very nice too. Awesome movie! It's the movie of the year! Excellent! And to Tim Burton's the nightmare before the christmas, happy Halloween!</p><hr><p><b>Katie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie of all time! The way it's put together is absolutely astounding! I haven't gotten on DVD yet. Just VHS. But I've loved it since I was little. Me and my cousin used to sing all the songs on it together, that's how much we'd watch it. Excellent movie! By far the greatest!</p><hr><p><b>Carly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm in LOVE with this movie. My laptop's back board is the Nightmare Before Christmas and I memorized all the songs.</p><hr><p><b>Lennart</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Incredible! There is simply no better explanation for the plot, songs and animations of this movie. My personal is Jack's Lament when he wanders lonely in the forest but I won't spoil anything if you haven't seen it. Totally advisable for people of all ages.</p><hr><p><b>Rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is THE BEST MOVIE in the WORLD! Tim Burton and Danny Elfman make THE BEST team ever. If you haven't seen this movie. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT! Any movie that can be around for 14 years and STILL have people talking about it HAS to be good.</p><hr><p><b>alexis</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Love it, who doesn't? But some parts are boring and too long.</p><hr><p><b>Brandi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely loved it. The first time I saw it it creeped me out but it's now one of the greatest movies ever.</p><hr><p><b>cory</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so beastly and jack is so awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Stripey</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A nearly flawless tale of love and adventure. Jack particularly intrigues me, both his outward appearance and his inward. I mean he's this big, scary guy, but deep down inside he's longing for something different. Boisterous, audacious Jack and gentle, quiet Sally make the perfect pair together.
The reason I haven't given it a nine or ten is because some of the song lyrics are a little contrived in quality, and some sections of the movie are a little dull. Tim Burton was my hero for awhile. I respect Danny Elfman's skill with all my heart. The characters, music, and story are crafted beautifully.
Really, it's a cult classic. Nonconformists hate it because it's so well and broadly-loved. But if one can look beyond the culture's obsession with the movie, one will discover a truly intriguing and heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance. </p><hr><p><b>Rebecca</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is definitely one of my favorites. Brilliant for Christmas and Halloween, and it's watched every year. The stop-animation technique must have taken ages, and its amazing how good they can get those films. In this one, in particular, the songs and music are well mastered, memorable characters make the scene and an engaging storyline makes it even more enjoyable. I wish Tim Burton would make more movies like this. Following on from this one, I tried "Corpse Bride", but wasn't as impressed. It was still the same lovable style, but it didn't stand up too well in comparison. As The Nightmare before Christmas is a classic.</p><hr><p><b>Hatter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, my mom doesn't though. I think it's one of Burton's best movies. </p><hr><p><b>evan M</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I know that this is a cult classic, but me and my sister still can't watch this movie cause it creeps us out.</p><hr></td>
