This is like a three-hour Right Guard commercial with full-on Hollywood blinkers, awful acting and the usual Bruckheimer-influenced flag fluttering, slow walks towards camera across runways and aircraft carriers and general heroic Yankee crap!</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Truly one of Hans Zimmer´s best perfomances ever.

Has to be the best film ever made.</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This sucks sooo badly.</p><hr><p><b>gracie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this film was amazing, the way they planned it was great. Also the fact that Josh Hartnett was in it made it better!</p><hr><p><b>tammy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever! Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are so H-O-T!</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>you americans are sure posers, you think the jap army was bad..check out the nuke you dropped on 2 jap cities, 200000 civilain casualties..lil babies and women..so dont go around saying your not killers..died in the wool killers..pearl harbour was the jap empire bitch slapping you awake cause as usual americans are fat and lazy cowards. and dont try to stand tall by saying ww2 was your as well..hitler was cooking jews while you all sat on your fat asses. the alamo, vietnam...pearl harbour, all loses america...losses..dont glorify your losses you cows. that chick from underworld was kinda hot..ben affleck is obviosly gay.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
Jesse, perhaps we ought not to refer to the Japanese as 'Japs', what do you think?

Or, for that matter, label every American a fat, lazy coward. That is the worst kind of insulting, antagonistic drivel you could possibly have spouted on a messageboard that is dedicated to movies. 

Tosser! 
</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie and own it along with a few books and such. I guess this is coming from someone working on becoming an airforce pilot, so what can I say! I loved it! Josh Hartnett plays a great Danny. And I must agree, that it wasn't so great to call the Japanese 'Japs', but that is what they were called then by the americans.</p><hr><p><b>americangirl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jesse - We don't go around saying we're not killers, but the japanese government isn't so innocent either. To get back to the movie - I love it, it's got friendship, romance and action.</p><hr><p><b>Christian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Bloody amazing I have seen two versions of this untold film, the uncut and cut. But I really don't care which version I watch, the film is ultimately groovy.</p><hr><p><b>Clare</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I know loads of people who don't like this film but personally I think it is the best film ever made and Ben Affleck is the yummiest person in the world.</p><hr><p><b>Jane Doe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jessie, shut the hell up! Who stuck the stick up your ass! I've seen the movie, I know it has flaws. But you calling the Americans fat lazy cowards, really pisses me off. And I'm Canadian! That's saying something. If you even knew a bit of WW2 history, or ever watched the movie you'll know that the Japanese were making peace talks with the Americans when they surprise attacked Pearl Harbor! Who are the cowards now, can you tell me that smart guy? Ben is not gay he dated Jennifer Lopez and is having a kid with Jennifer Garner.</p><hr><p><b>corina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favorite movies! Josh Hartnett is so HOT! And Hans Zimmer has made the best music. By the way jesse, americans aren't fat lazy cowards!</p><hr><p><b>mollie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie and I cry at the end like every time I watch it. Josh Hartnett is so hot! It's a great film.</p><hr><p><b>lindsay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This moving was amazing and I loved it! Just like every other girl that saw it I cried at the end! And Josh Hartnett is totally the hottest guy! This movie was so intense that it made me become what I am today, a USA pilot (but not combat fighting!).</p><hr><p><b>Ellyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jesse how slack can you get? If you had any idea what that part of history was about you would know not to say that! If it wasn't for America and Aussies who knows how the Japanese would have made history? If they can lie to a country about all their "peace talk crap" then who knows what else they can do! Well anyways, that movie was so awesome times 10 and I love Ben Affleck! I'm so sad he's married haha. Pearl Harbor is so good and I recommend it for anyone.</p><hr><p><b>Ead</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favorites and I love Josh so much. I don't know why someone hated this. The actors in this movie were very good and did their best. You can open wide your heart to see how they are. Josh did his best to love someone and you can feel this by yourself. Also Ben must stay away and agree with the thing he had left behind. The plot was suitable and in the real world you may see the story like this. Torn between two lovers. Feeling like a fool, right?</p><hr><p><b>Jacobus Myburgh</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Pearl Harbour is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I would recommend it for anyone that love a love triangle!</p><hr><p><b>Kelta</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much, all the acting in it is phenomenal! And not to mention that Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are pretty hot in this film too. The sound effects and the visuals are amazing! It seems almost like they were actually filming it in real life. Definitely one of my favourite movies!</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Ok, but not brilliant. The actual movie is a decent affair but Randal Wallace's script is heavy handed. It's easy to see where some of the visuals came from upon reading this, like the bomb falling from the plane to the Arizona, but things like the Torpedo skimming up the beach to destroy a house. WTH? A good story, impressive visuals to make you feel what the attack was like, but ultimately this version of the script smells of too much flag waving.</p><hr><p><b>chocolate_lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really love that movie, it was so good. It had action, romance and a little comedy (how the actors played the characters). I cried and I don't care that it goes for 3 hours.</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I was conned into watching Pearl Harbor on the basis that "it's so bad it's good". Like hell it is! This film is just spleen-rupturingly awful! How anyone in their right mind can possibly give it ten stars is beyond me. It's the movie equivalent of a full frontal lobotomy. In fact if anyone from the CIA is reading, I suggest using it as an aggressive interrogation technique. Simply strap your Dirka-Dirka (sorry, I mean "enemy combatant") into a chair in front of this film and he'll soon be begging for rendition to Guantanamo Bay. Anyone who wants to see a decent movie about the Pearl Harbor attack should watch From Here To Eternity instead, or better still read the novel by James Jones.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>At last, someone else brings some common sense and a genuinely critical eye to the messageboard! I was getting lonely there for a while.</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Cheers for the support Limey. Always nice to come across a fellow sentient being. To add one more point to my original post, just what is with all the women on this messageboard gushing over how romantic this film is. I mean surely they can't be serious? Hartnett-Affleck-Beckinsale must be the most insipid love triangle in movie history. I'd rather watch toads mate, than see any more of their constipated, no chemistry "romance". I reckon most of the female posters here must be dating, or married to some real boring bastards, if this movie can count as a fantasy for them. Or maybe they just don't have anybody at all.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Nobody at all would be my guess. It's like a three-hour Gillette commercial this film, which makes it all the more surprising that women should take such an interest. Maybe they are particularly masculine on this message board and can't get enough of this petrol-fest, this homo-erotic pissing contest, with all of its sweat-soaked vests, nauseating stereotypes and Technicolour explosions.</p><hr><p><b>marisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The americans glorify themselves too much. They waited, and waited, and waited to go to war. But what is done is done. The best thing about this movie (and the reason I'm giving it a three) is the music. And I mean. Look at the love triangle, for the love of god! The guy just died a few months ago and she's already shagging his best friend. I mean, that's just sick.</p><hr><p><b>Kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>First off I think that it was a great movie. And to the COMPLETE MORON who is critizing america for dropping a nuclear weapon, are you joking ?

they almost completly took out our entire naval fleet at pearl, can you not grasp that it was pertinent to get back our hold in the war by bombing them? 

your an idiot, a ton of research went into that movie and for the most part is historicaly accurate, and if your just critizising the acting, your seriously fooled, they are amazing actors and your probabaly jealous

hey learn some history. You would have died if americans didnt join in on the war because your army was too pathetic to defends its self, 
please don't get me started on this topic you will obvioulsy lose.</p><hr><p><b>Natasha</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Tremendous love story.</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Re: Kelly, whose army was too pathetic to defend itself? Don't know what you're talking about. Surely you can't be talking about Britain, which received no official support from the US whatsoever! You think I'll lose this topic through not knowing my history. Try me!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Complete and utter jingoistic bollocks!</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Natasha, Casablanca is a tremendous love story. Pearl Harbor is about as romantic as syphilis.</p><hr><p><b>mary</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I want a love story like this! But the one with josh hartnett. He is so hot.</p><hr><p><b>Jones</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>It was OK. Limey, lay off the crap. Stupid bloke, always going on about the yank BS. Well, in many ways he is right about our military. If you have read any proper books on the Yanks in WWII, you'll find they won against a tough enemy. The Japs took us out at Burma, and they were a hell of a lot tougher than the Germans (THEY didn't strap grenades or satchel charges to themselves and throw their hulk into a pillbox, now did they?). It took 2 atomic bombs to convince the Emperor to surrender, and even then, the commanders of the Japanese military didn't want to quit! In fact, they even came up with an elaborate plan in 1947 to remove the Emperor from power and begin their little war again. The only thing that stopped them was the Emperor saying "This is madness! My people are dying from the most destructive weapon on EARTH!" You really should learn to respect the Yanks a lot more than what you give them credit for during the war.</p><hr><p><b>Jessica</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing movie. The music is one of the best things about it. I do honestly agree about the love triangle that she did get into things with his best friend pretty quick but it made the story interesting. But to the people who are saying the things about Americans like we are "fat, lazy cowards" need to shut their mouths. It's none of your business what we do. I agree some are lazy but just because of the ones that are you shouldn't pretty much stereotype ALL Americans.</p><hr><p><b>bwdial</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Jesse...first off...you are an idiot. Those 200,000 civilians would have been a drop in the bucket compared with the loss of life that would have occurred had the United States been forced to fight a land war on the Japanese mainland. 
Do you have any clue about the atrocities committed by the Japanese during their occupation of the Chinese mainland? Do you have any idea about the rape and brutality that was visited upon Nanking? British nurses in Hong Kong?
Limey...how was the United States "too pathetic to defend itself?" Was it because we got caught napping? I'm sure the pilots who broke American laws to fly in defense of England might take issue with that attitude.
As for the film, I thought it was pretty crap. Michael Bay is a good second unit director at best. Simply a sappy melodrama with CGI. </p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>bwdial, I think you've got the wrong end of the stick. Read the preceding messages for clarification. I was in fact responding to someone else's suggestion that Britain 'was too pathetic to defend itself'.




</p><hr><p><b>matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>So bad it almost makes me cry. It's an utterly banal, stupid, moronic, idiotic, retarded piece of drivel. The fact that most of the people praising it usually also throw in 'omg hartnet iz sooo hot!!!' proves that this film has no artistic, political, social or philosophical merits whatsoever. The plot is stupid, the romantic subplot is ridiculously contrived, the acting is phoned-in, and the fact that a man of Cuba Gooding's abilities was reduced to playing the 'yessir-nosir-idiotic-black-man-who-comes-good-in-the-end' role proves that the money really talked on this one. It's a waste of time. Watch 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Band of Brothers' if you're after something you can watch without wincing for all the wrong reasons.</p><hr><p><b>peter avery</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>There is one thing wrong with this film.. 3 hours long. I think it was released around the same time as titanic and they wanted to make pearl harbor into a love story with a backdrop of the bombing of the harbor. 2 hours long and this would have been a very nice, compact film. Jerry Bruckheimer is a very good producer and Michael Bay is an accomplished director, but I think they lacked the foresight to really make a statement here with a part of American history that was just so important at the time.</p><hr><p><b>Wahalem Abdul Abdeen</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>What is it with all the american hate. Is america that bad? We have war here in the Gaza every day, i dont see anyone coming out here to help us out! bombs exploding and people dying left and right, it's just part of life. You wake up one day and maybe you dont go to sleep that night. </p><hr><p><b>joanna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pearl Harbor is AMAZING. Michael Bay does an excellent job producing it. I love Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, and Ben Affleck in this movie and think that the acting was awesome. Its pretty accurate historically as well, and really got me interested in the whole history aspect of it. I just love this movie it is the absolute best!</p><hr><p><b>peter avery</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>i can't believe they tried to make this movie like titanic. 3 hours long? come on, guys.!! tora tora tora is the best perl harbour movie by a long way. I like this film, but say what you have to say in 2 hours, huh? the bravery that was dispalyed that day was unbelieviable.Imagine watching the arizona sink before your eyes, then see it again 60 feet below the surface!!! </p><hr><p><b>Katie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Alright to be honest, it was a great movie, takes me about three days to get over the heart ache of it. The acting was fine, script great, plot was awesome, but putting that aside, for all of those who find this movie horrible maybe you should set aside the fact that it is Hollywood and try to grasp the understanding that this was entirely based on the happenings of what actually took place at pearl harbor. If that doesn't make your heart sink then maybe you should go get some adjustments. Like any other man or women working, because to remind you acting, directing and producing is still a job, Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and many others were just doing thier jobs. This movie made money, yes but it was placed out there for people to get the exposure, to understand that the world isn't always nice. And to show you some of what truly happened and how incredibly brutal it was. Just try to imagine YOUR entire fleet sitting like ducks, not having anything ready no guns cannons not anything ready for what was to happen not even a minute of warning. There were over 1700 men still trapped in the arizonia when it sunk, there were air pockets in the ship and they survived, for a while.Jump outside of your little mind and think beyond the movie and lsearch for the truth cuz its not always distant.</p><hr><p><b>Michael</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>The fact that Disney paid $2M for this script gives me GREAT hope for my screenplay set in 1940s Germany. Like, TONS and TONS of hope.</p><hr><p><b>j</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Oh poor Abdul. Stop the cycle. You only get bombed cause idiots bomb your neighbor. Leave Israel alone and you would have your own state by now. Jess, you're obvious an anti American fool. Yes they were lazy in 39 and 40, but they came through in 42 and 44 when we needed them. The nuke was the best option and Japan wasn't innocent for atrocities. Stop watching anti American tv and read a real book. America has its flaws, but show me a country that doesn't. But as for the movie, well it's far to "we won the war alone", but a good film really and great music.</p><hr><p><b>Some Dude</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Quite possible the least entertaining movie I have ever seen, which is unforgivable, given that it was 3 hours of total fiction. The only 3 things that saved this movie for me were that: 1- I saw it in a theatre in Tokyo, 2- we brought a whoopee cushion, and 3: we almost got thrown out of the theatre because of said whoopee cushion.</p><hr><p><b>Manvendra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have watched this movie for atleast 5 times. I love the romance shown in this movie. It was really heart touching. The music was so romantic. Romance scene between Rafe and Evllin was marvellous. Though I feel pity for rafe when he returned after death and he has to face that his love is now with his best frnd. That was really heart rending. I think this was the second most romantic love story after titanic.</p><hr><p><b>chelsea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the best movie I've ever seen. Nd 4 all you haters. Your jus jealous tht you can't be as hot or as good of an actor as ben affleck. The people tht hate this movie are either japanese, hate america, or are depressd, because this was an amazing movie. I have seen this movie about 10 times in the past week, and it jus gets betta every time I see it. Don't hate on this movie because your depressd. Because this is THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.</p><hr><p><b>chelsea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I totally agree with kelly, limey. GET A LIFE. You obviously don't know what your talking about. Pearl harbor was a total attack by surprise, do you expect us to be prepared by a surprise attack? I'm into history. DON'T TEST ME. Your the one that doesn't know what your talking about. This movie is an almost exact showcase of events that happened on december 7. Don't take your anger out on us, because PEARL HARBOR WAS A FANTASTIC MOVIE.</p><hr><p><b>Marie</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Oh yes, and by the way. Leaving Jesse out of all this, I think Pearl Harbor is the BEST MOVIE EVER CREATED IN HISTORY (with Titanic), I don't particularly think that Josh Harntnett is hot, and I didn't like his character! I SOOO prefer Ben Affleck! Kate Beckinsale is great, even though she's British (right Jesse?) and the romance is just amazing. Thank you Michael Bay PS: just one last thing Jesse, Pearl Harbor is written with no "u".</p><hr><p><b>Marie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I just kept reading and I found myself responding to Kelly. Look, I love Americans, all right? But I don't think you should respond to Jesse by insulting the 40' army. You guys, we're not in the war anymore. Honestly, French people didn't move their asses either, but that is something you shouldn't use to get back at Jesse. Because he's got nothing to do with that And yes, Europeans are very grateful to you -I know I am- for coming rescue us. That is something I will never forget.</p><hr><p><b>Andreas</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Hmm, I came down to this site to search on Roosevelt's or anybody's speech when Doolittle's squadron is about to reach the Japanes coast-line before the raid or when Doolittle's squadron about to reach the coast-line of Chinese after the raid, which sounds like "Let them tell that to." that I can't remember, due to my poor english understanding and the movie's rarely being played at tv right now in my country. But I have to say, the movie's good, and Hans Zimmer really put an awesome music to the movie. I saved 3 months of my pocket money to get the original CD soundtrack of this movie, and it's really worth it.</p><hr></td>
