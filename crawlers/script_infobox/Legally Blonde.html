Thank-you blonde-lover!

If being 'cool' means enjoying this cowpat of a film, with all its vaccuous froth and bubble, then I am delighted not to qualify.  

P.S: You're quite right that I'm someone with not a lot to do at present; bored in an office in England. 

Do American girls really say things like 'Ohmigod'. I thought only Britney Spears did that?

</p><hr><p><b>absolutely</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Not an exciting film, but it's entertaining... It can be watched at a night that you want to slow down but not want to lose your energy for working :)) good enough to watch at a spare time (for a movielover) .</p><hr><p><b>blonde</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>oh my god, I love this movie! </p><hr><p><b>2hot2handle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie with a passion!

You obviously have not seen the movie because if you did you would agree with everyone else that it's a great movie. Even you brits should recognise good comedy when it presents itself! Get back to me when you see the movie.</p><hr><p><b>barbie</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Well OMG I'm gonna have to agree with Percival it is a pretty good movie but up above it's mentioned that she is standing up for smart blondes. The only way she got into the law school was because of her looks, I think that's bagging out blondes in a sense saying that we are good for nothing just like everyone else does. How is this standing up for us? And she only wins the case because like all blondes she knows what she is doing with her APPEARANCE not because she is smart! But all in all the movie was alright, if you have nothing better to do.</p><hr><p><b>chloe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was an awesome movie. I'm watching it right now, lol it's so funny. Reese does an awesome job as Elle. I loved this movie!</p><hr><p><b>chocochick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I totally love this movie. My friend Vikki says it makes her feel good about being a blonde. I being a brunette am in love with it anyway. Such an awesome chick flick!</p><hr><p><b>yay blonde yay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm a brit and I love this film, see some of us have good taste.</p><hr><p><b>Blonde Babe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey Percival, you and Barbie should get together and diss all the other greatest movies ever made! You both need to get a life! I wish I could choose 100 out of 10. I've seen the movie a lot and know it all by heart.</p><hr><p><b>Brazilian 20</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Folks let's stop arguing about this movie Legally Blonde. This is the best movie I've ever seen, so If I'm telling this is the best....it's the best! For those who don't like my scrap, I'm really sorry! Wooahh.</p><hr><p><b>veronica</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Purcival is entitled to her own opinion; we all are. Just because she has different tastes doesn't mean we should all criticize her for it (I'm sorry, Purcival, I'm assuming you're a girl because it seems only girls are commenting).  You can't exactly say she's stupid for not liking this movie; she just doesn't like these types. And in the same respect, Purcival, these people are just voicing their opinion.</p><hr><p><b>BRITTANY</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If I could have voted higher than 10 I would have! I love that movie, Elle Woods is a role model for all  blondes everywhere.</p><hr><p><b>Blonde Babe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OK I know Purcival probably hasn't read this thing in a while because she hasn't said anything. It has been months since I last took part in this little conversation. But if Purcival is still reading this I'm sorry to you and Barbie about what I said. Veronica is right everyone is entitled to their own opinion. My personal opinion is that this is the best movie ever made, but that's only me.</p><hr><p><b>Purcival</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>
I'm sorry too, each to their own! </p><hr><p><b>natalie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well girls I LOVED the movie! It was absolutely FAB. Just proves all those brunette girls that blondes aren't all dumb! And we are all capable of accomplishing what we want. What and who is Purcival? Because that girl/thing really needs to relax, obviously you're just jealous! GO BLONDES! mmwah.</p><hr><p><b>Lynsey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much! It's great. I remember the second time I watched it I dressed up in pink and did everything Elle (Reese Witherspoon) did! I stopped eventually though. This is an excellent film and girls should definitely love it.</p><hr><p><b>ubetta</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG! This movie is the best! Everyone should be influenced. Elle's not judgemental, she's kind to everyone and she goes for what's right. What's NOT  to love about this movie!</p><hr><p><b>Jamie</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Haha it is so funny how Percival leaves a comment and then all these little girls try to bash her by saying things like "you frigid bitch" which is off Legally Blonde which would qualify you little girls as obsessed. But whatever this was a good movie. Not oscar-worthy, but still good. Not something I'd let my kids watch though.</p><hr><p><b>ellen</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Stop acting like spoilt bitches to Percival. It was a crap movie and Elle in the end was a stupid blonde. She won the case because she knew a lot about hair not about law. Anyone who says this movie inspired them to become a lawyer seriously needs to get a reality check and should forget about law school and stick to watching dumb teen comedies. By the way, the only reason I watched this movie is because it was an english assignment.</p><hr><p><b>Demi and Brandon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I can't believe anyone would hate this movie but what was said before, everyone is supposed to have their own opinion. This is what makes the comments on this comment board interesting, people that didn't like the movie left good reasons why they didn't like it. Also it is just a movie and Elle Woods isn't a real person. We like the movie because it's not only the smart people that can succeed it's the not so smart people as well. Anyone can do it if they put their mind to it. They just have to get their break and she got hers.</p><hr><p><b>tumai</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Purcival rocks!</p><hr><p><b>Lucille</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was awesome! I really enjoyed it.</p><hr><p><b>ashley</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I think Legally Blonde was good. I have watched it so many times though and am getting sick of it.</p><hr><p><b>Ranita</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. Even though I am not a blonde! It really does make those that think blondes are stupid to shut up. I hope they make a third movie!</p><hr><p><b>SUPER ZHZ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I just don't understand why you guys think of this movie as a best movie ever. It's just a simple story, not meaningful, no inspiration. By the way, is Reese beautiful? I don't think so.</p><hr><p><b>WhiteWings</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Wow. The given script was very different from the movie. Anyways, I love romantic comedies and this was a good example of one. It isn't all lovey-dovey all the time; there were pretty big conflicts involved too. Being looked down upon for something you can't help about yourself is a big thing (I know), and not only does she deal with it everywhere she goes but she also deals with it in a very graceful way. She helps other people with their problems and is an all-around good person, though a little silly at times (yay!). Elle is also a smart person; she can analyze a situation and handle it correctly, and she works hard to acquire any other knowledge she was missing. I'm not a law student (I'm an art student), but aren't those qualities a lawyer should have? So this movie shows that anything can be achieved when you put your heart in it, and to not be afraid to find your true calling and chase your dreams (or in this case the "love of your life"). It gives the rest of us dreamers hope, because who really knows what we could do for the world? The only real problem I had with the movie is that they played around with stereotypes a bit too much. I've never believed that someone could be placed in a single category as plain and simple as that. That, and I think it would've been good to end it there, but let's not get into that. My post came out pretty long! Anyways, it was a good movie with good messages. PS: SUPER ZHZ, if you didn't like the movie as much, why did you give it a ten out of ten?</p><hr><p><b>tasha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE legally blonde, it's a great movie and I can relate to her troubles! I'm blonde and I want to be a teacher so I know how she feels to be laughed at and stuff. I personaly reckon it's an 11 out of 10, but you can't do that so.</p><hr><p><b>Katie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love legally blonde one and two! Like wow. I love how she stands up for blondes. I get teased because I'm blonde, it's sad. And now I have proof that blondes are smart.</p><hr><p><b>Kandykizzer</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I was born brunette, now blonde. What I think - hair colours are all beautiful! Red, Brunette, Blonde whatever. I hate how people bag each other out for hair colour. This was an excellent movie. Remember blondes, if anyone calls you dumb, say you must be dumb, you really think hair colour says who you are?</p><hr><p><b>Hittebarnet</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Oh for God's sake! You must be retarded, the lot of you! Seriously, this movie is the _worst_ movie ever. It's so bad, that bad movies about bad things are badder than bad horse crap from a bad land with bad farmer-boys with bad clothes. I'm not joking. Do NOT see this movie. 

Also, I think that all the 10 year-olds should stay quiet. If you cannot spell, nor use proper grammar, don't write anything at all, "k lolol this movie is so q't. 2 of my boifriends saw it with me and I laffed lol!"- Slap! Now stay down.</p><hr><p><b>Super-Fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry but I just think this is a really dumb movie and there was no reason to make it. Sorry again.</p><hr><p><b>Whatever</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Movies are made for entertainment and money. If you don't like it, you don't like it. Whatever. 
There are more inspirational events and people in the news, because they are actually real stories. So stop talking about the blonde hair thing. You are just trying to find a reason to support your personal issues. 
Oh and Hittebarnet, don't talk about other people's grammar when you are using 'badder'. As long as you can read the stuff they write, who cares. 
Anyway, this was an enjoyable film to watch.</p><hr><p><b>xoxJeccaxox</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever. And I am not even blonde at the moment. HaHa. It's great and sweet. And all you haters just suck. Anywho I love this movie. It rocks.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Dang, what a catfight. Anyway, personally I really liked this movie, because I thought it was cute. But still, as everybody said before, they have a right to voice their own opinion, and if they hate it, then, they can bash it all they want. But if they like it, they can praise it all they want. So, it doesn't really matter to me, but I'm just saying. Well, it was a cute movie and I personally enjoyed it.</p><hr><p><b>Allyson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best. Especially since MY aunt is REESE WITHERSPOON! And I got to try on ALL of her outfits. And I got to kiss CHANNING TATUM, because my sister is Amanda Bynes. We have so many jokes together! Also just to really make you mad, I was SUPPOSED to be Rose in Titanic! I would have done WAY better. But I'll give her her Props. Sorry that you wish you were ME! DON"T BE JEALOUS!</p><hr><p><b>meggy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved these legally blonde movies and I have both of them. This movie really inspired me because I am blonde and get teased because of it and my favorite color is pink. All of you who are writing mean stuff stop, because you're just making a big deal out of it to get heard.</p><hr><p><b>PinkGirl</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It's a great movie! Reese Witherspoon really captures the character of 'Elle', a blonde, girly-girl who want to go to Harvard so her ex-boyfriend will want to get back together since she wasn't 'professional enough' for him. I highly recommend you watch this movie!</p><hr><p><b>pinklover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. Plus the awesome thing is that I got to play Elle in a Legally Blonde play we did in my town. It's so much fun. And since I live near San Francisco, I got to see the musical "Legally Blonde." You can definitely call me a total F-A-N! PS: Always remember girls - you got to BEND and SNAP!</p><hr></td>
