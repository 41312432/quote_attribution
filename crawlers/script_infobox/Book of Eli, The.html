  <tr>
    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Joy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Brilliantly conceived plot and a breathtaking back-drop. The climax is truly capturing. Much more than the rationale, this script has a soul. Something that keeps up hope. While reading, we can clearly visualize the desolate terrain in our imagination. Thank you Mr. Gary Whitta, for creating such an inspiring work.</p><hr><p><b>theblackrabbitofinle</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I read this script without watching the movie first and I found flaws with it. There are areas where the story is interesting but also areas where it's slow. The dialogue and some of the scenes are cliche. The main girl acts like a chick from a bad horror film, constantly crying and screaming every time she sees something scary. It seems as if the writer has a very narrow view of women. I don't want to reveal the plot but there was a scene where the girl's actions did not match what a normal human's emotions would have been, and she also experiences a complete personality change that is unlikely, given her initial portrayal. If the writer is going to have one of his characters grow or have their personality change, he has to show it along the way. So when I came across this part in the script I found it far-fetched. The villains are also poorly developed. The ending was interesting though. I got the impression that the script was at time touching upon some enlightening subjects, but then it would disappoint me as it became 2-dimensional again.</p><hr><p><b>Sally</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It simply rips you apart. Got tears to my eyes and I haven't even seen the movie. So well written, it is very easy to imagine. Beautiful. It truly touched me.</p><hr><p><b>Teresa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've watched the movie and I have found this by far the most entertaining of all movies in its caliber. It was life like in the characters and typical for a no account generation of self-serving idiots. People in some parts of the Bible felt like Gary Oldman's character did in the movie. Denzel was a great choice because all the prophets of the Bible were black israelites.</p><hr><p><b>pmdz</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I've notice the comment that 'theblackraddibtofinle' posted. Of course they are some flaws. That's in almost every movie. I'll disagree with what he said, I'm sure the writer has a broad view of women. The way the women acted or reacted I believe was the right way. And you cannot blame the writing for the way the actor acts. But you can surely blame the director awesome movie! I love it. It was great.</p><hr><p><b>Khayelihle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the great script I have ever read, and the movie itself is a revelation in it own league, compelling writting and the intrigue that keep you glued to the screen, in one word I can Just call it MARVELOUS.</p><hr><p><b>barryblackwell</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>As a neo apocalyptic action adventure screen writer, I can appreciate the subtle nuance Gary Whitta sought to achieve in his work. A screen play must first be visual, and his "Heart of Darkness" feel made the script easy to become a part of. All actors seek to be challenged and there's enough there to let them go off. In a Hollywood world where everyone holds to the William Goldman notion "If I want to send a message, I'll contact Western Union" it's a miracle this fine screenplay's inner message of devotion to a higher calling ever got made at all. It's a fine script, well done and totally pro. Asses in seats baby.</p><hr><p><b>bloodrunsclear</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>The IMSDB apparently believes if a film contains religion at all (Christian religion mind you) its too much. Actually the film was very a-religious and wish-washy on that point. (The Bible is compared equally with other religious traditions, is sought after by the villain to use for power. Etc) The Bible in anything but a negative light I suppose is too much for most people, but that is at least one of the reasons this film stands out. It at least tried to portray Christians and Christian beliefs in a neutral fashion which I appreciated. If you are not Christian the validity of the religion is neither confirmed or denied so you're perfectly fine enjoying this film, no matter what IMSDB says. Likewise the film is beautifully shot, has some great effects, funny lines of dialogue and intriguing characters. Its a tight film that feels small but at the same time encompasses the entirety of the human experience. It didn't irritate me as much as other post apocalyptic films because the themes were less heavy handed, the violence and darkness more suggested making it more powerful. All in all a well crafted genre film, an interesting investigation, and worth seeing based on the unique visual style alone.</p><hr><p><b>Rob</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Unless you're really into religion, the idea that a book will save or doom the planet should seem a bit silly.</p><hr><p><b>bigrockybear</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have not seen the movie, but this script is other-worldly. It brought tears to my eyes, and I can't wait to actually see it now. It will probably disappoint, but I thought the story line was brilliant, the action just right mixed with drama, and a very surprising, very heart-warming ending. No, the book won't save the planet, but the faith it brings as one reads it most certainly will.</p><hr><p><b>Gilliganda Panda </b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I think the movie was very well done. The set extensions were seamless making Eli seem like he actually was walking down this nuclear-fallout post-apocalyptic quest. A shame the script on here isn't written properly the whole way through. Once THE CAT is introduced at the start, don't capitalize it again. It is confusing and makes me think possibly there is another cat. Apart from that all and all 9 out of 10 for the movie, 6. 5 out of 10 for script.</p><hr><p><b>Bor</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Rob's comment is a bit silly, itself. There are plenty of stories and movies about books powerful enough to save or doom planets and civilizations. Religion or the lack thereof has nothing to do with it. I find it amusing in the extreme that given a magical component people are willing to accept such a premise, but given a religious component the idea becomes somehow nonsensical. That being said, I struggled a bit with the movie at times, but overall found it positive. Some minor formatting issues aside, the script was well done.</p><hr><p><b>Mars</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>It is enjoyable enough, at times. Some of the casting was suprising, and maybe not in a good way. Silly stuff like this is okay, but the ending dragged and indulged in its own self importance.</p><hr><p><b>Tiffiny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent film to watch as I put myself in Eli’s shoes. I have had the exact same experience myself, where God has directed me towards the Book (Bible) to create a new reality where hidden time intersects with present time. The book is a guide, just as Eli was instructed, I have been instructed to do the same. Great story behind the truth of God’s guidance to those who listen and the lifelong dedication of those who choose to follow. Ultimately it is for the betterment of human kind. </p><hr></td>
