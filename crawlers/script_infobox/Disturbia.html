We love you SHIA LEBEOFE.</p><hr><p><b>Sydney Holbrook</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie, it was awesome. Anyways, I really enjoyed it. My $8 movie ticket was totally worth it.</p><hr><p><b>Kristina Rennieee!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the BEST movie ever! I loved it SO much but none of my friends understand why I laughed when the car flipped. I thought it was funny because it was unexpected! But I cried at the end. So it kind of replaced the laughing.</p><hr><p><b>dani</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love shia labeouf. This movie was totally worth seeing especially in the theaters. I'm going to buy it as soon as it comes out for sure.</p><hr><p><b>Uebelator</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Nice script. Haven seen the movie yet, but heard a lot of good things about it. I'm curious to see what the Shia Lebeofe hype is all about (there has got to be a reason why he is in Indy 4). I liked the script. Really had a good time reading it and loved the nice mix of suspense and silliness. SPOILERS AHEAD: (don't read any further, if you haven't read the script or seen the movie). There are one or two things, that are a little too clichéd. We have seen the hero lose his father on the edge of a cliff a million times. And his funny Sidekick Ronnie (why do Sidekicks always have nicknames instead of real ones?) is just that: A funny sidekick, added for some comic relief. Nothing more, nothing less. I really don't want to see more horror-showdowns, that take place during a thunderstorm, on the roof of a house. It felt like a Deja-Vu of countless other films (The Crow, Edward Scissorhands, etc).</p><hr><p><b>neveralways</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought a lot of things in the script were similar to the movie, but some weren't like the ending and how exactly the dad died and some of the lines and a few other things. So I felt the movie was better than the script, but both are still good. So my rating is towards the script not the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Erin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this script is AMAZING! I mean, parts of it are predictable, but others are unexpected. I think the actors really understood what the writers wanted for the characters.</p><hr><p><b>Alyssa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was one of the first awesome movies that I have ever seen.  I went with four other people(2 guys and 2 girls) and they also loved it.  I hate scary movies but I loved this one.</p><hr><p><b>Alisha</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie was great! I'm a big fan of 'Rear Window' so it was nice to see and update for my generation.</p><hr><p><b>Shia's girlfriend</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yes I love this move because it's funny, sexy and scary. Ew why did you laugh when the car flipped! sorry but thats kinda messed up!</p><hr><p><b>Dravin</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Yes, I did like this movie. There could've been some more action in the movie. Plot and setting was good. But I didn't expect to see Shia Lebeofe in this movie. He played in I Robot and Transformers The Movie and that was acceptable. Mark my words: He is a upcoming rising star. The scene in the beginning where they were both in the car when it flipped was shocking. Was the driver in the pick up who cause the disaster the killer who was fleeing from Texas? I wonder. Because I thought that this film was going to be chasing that driver until the end of the world. And for the killer: they picked the right guy for that role. When I saw his face I got the cramps in my stomach. But I enjoyed the movie. Because I learned how to act when I have a suspicious neighbor. I think I'm going to add this movie also in my collection. Be.</p><hr><p><b>shimpanzee</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think the script fell short at the end. The struggle was really corney and I'm happy the film was taken in another direction. The movie was really great and had a reasonable ending. The scripts fight scene seemed way to wes craven for my taste.</p><hr><p><b>Jessica</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. I saw it with my best friend the night it came out, best time I've had in a while. We went to see it because she loves Shia, but I was surprised on actually how good he was at playing his charactor. I've seen him in so many funny roles it was great to see him in this movie and him still do well at it. Just proves he's a great actor.</p><hr><p><b>Stephen Michael Ballif</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>	Disturbia is a nice thriller that has the ability to charm thrill seekers of all ages.  The film is a new look at the classic mystery of solving a crime from a distance, no matter what the cost, such as Rear Window.  Those familiar with this film will enjoy a new modern twist of this story.  Younger viewers will also enjoy it due to the high school setting filled with the trends and issues of teens.
	The script has a great opening.  Immediately, the reader is drawn in.  The dialogue and action at the beginning quickly set the mood and tone for the rest of the film.  It is funny, intense, and real.
	The protagonist is quickly developed and most importantly understood by the reader as we see him deal with the situation following a terrible tragedy.  He has a clear personality and powerful intentions as the story unfolds.  He is likable and clearly a teenager facing the troubles and situations of that age.
	Not only does the script have a great protagonist, but it also has an excellent antagonist.  This character is carefully developed and revealed as the protagonist pursues his goals.  The slow development is great for a mystery and suspense film.
	The action lines of the script contain several lines that refer to what the character is thinking.  Screenplays tend to steer away from these types of phrases due to the visual medium, but the lines in this script are effective.  Although not filmable in the sense of direct interpretation, the lines create a clear image for the reader who can interpret it the way they imagine it.  This is strong, allowing the reader to create an image that he or she can beleive.
	The script contains a great amount of tension, created through careful writing.  As the events unfold, the writers paced the scenes well, not revealing too much, but making the reader question and wonder.  The sense of danger and fear is heavy throughout the pages.
	This script is a fun read with realistic dialogue and actions.  The final film contains scenes that improve it, but this draft stands strong on its own.  The technology and trends of the high school life are well written and expressed through writing that creates a visual understanding of the story.</p><hr><p><b>Stripey</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>An okay-crafted movie. 
However, I didn't enjoy how the camera ogled at the young lady. She had so much to show other than her body. She was a very strong character, very crucial to the story. I also think the end was contrived. The story itself was pretty standard; nothing original, really. The sidekick was a sidekick. Nothing more. The bad guy was a bad guy, we didn't really know anything about him.

There were no twists. They suspected the neighbor from the very beginning.

Really, I did enjoy it, but it was too predictable for me to necessarily LOVE. </p><hr><p><b>Michelle Karman</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>This wasn't a very good movie, the action was lame, the story was typical - and how many teenagers actually throw huge drinking parties? It seems like every so-called horror movie uses this tired scene...the huge high school/college drinking party.  I guess they can't come up with anything fresh and I'm not giving out any free advice here. To get back to Disturbia, the ending was a total cliche and I'm so glad that I did not waste my hard-earned money going to see this in the theatres.</p><hr><p><b>Container</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was a great movie! My favorite actor here was for sure David Morse. He was so in to this movie and preformed his part very well. Not only does this movie have a story about a kid who knows he lives by a killer but can't do anything, but it has a tremendous amount of action, suspense, comedy, and romance. Shia Labeouf gave a great performance too.</p><hr></td>
