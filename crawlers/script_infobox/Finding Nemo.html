Or even a 25 word pitch of original concept.</p><hr><p><b>Steph</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>DORY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Raquel Sarabia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite part of "Finding Nemo" was when the shark Bruse was going to eat them and they ran inside that room where people sleep and Dory tried to read the word ''escape" and she pronoced it wrong and she tells him "that's funny it's spelled just like the word ''escape.'' lol. I watched it over and over. Another was where she sings to that fish that was going to eat her and she says, "no no no no eating here tonight cuz you on a diet!!!!" that was the funny part. there are lots of the other parts that i like to but too many to say. That is the funniest animated movie that i have seen.</p><hr><p><b>Allison Haase</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OH MY GOD .. I LOVE SQUIRT. HE IS SOO CUTE AND ADORABLE. I LOVE HIM TO DEATH AND HE IS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM FINDING NEMO!!!!</p><hr><p><b>umut</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>perfect for teaching english</p><hr><p><b>Macie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so cute!! I love Squirt too he is awesome!! I like when that one fish says "I'm gonna go touch the butt!!" when it's really supposed to be boat!! That is so cute!!</p><hr><p><b>Rabbit</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i love finding nemo. my favorite person from the movie was sqirt. he is cool. i liked when tho one fish called the boat a butt.i also liked when the shark dressed up like a dolphin as a disguise.SQUIRT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Ray</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>BEST CASTING! The movie has some of the best actors and actresses including Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Willem Dafoe, and Allison Janney. They all do the best job for this movie.  I think a real actor should of done the voice for the sea turtle surfer dude instead of the director, Andrew Stanton.  </p><hr><p><b>chardix</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie is so great! Ellen Degeneres is so perfect for Dory's voice! Dory is my most favorite Disney character today!</p><hr><p><b>me</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, this is all my friends and I ever talk about and we're 13.</p><hr><p><b>NEMO</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film ever. Dory's jokes - I have short term memory loss - runs in the family, wait hmmm does it... where is my family... (looks up at Marlin) hi I'm Dory how can I help? So funny. Squirt is cool!</p><hr><p><b>Molly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. Me and my friends quote it all the time and let's just say we are probably too old to enjoy it. It rocks my socks off!</p><hr><p><b>xXBLACKEAGLEXx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Finding Nemo. I watch it over and over, I'm obsessed. This movie kicks ass and always makes me laugh. I have too many favorite parts and too many favorite characters!</p><hr><p><b>Jessi</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love Finding Nemo, I really like the little squishy. I love it when Dora talks about Squishy. Aww. Too cute, too cute!
</p><hr><p><b>Mari</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Finding Nemo wow! I like the story. It is so beautiful. Dory was so funny, Marlin serious and sometimes funny. Squirt and Nemo are awesome friends.</p><hr><p><b>Nemo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Fish are friends, fish are not food!</p><hr><p><b>nik</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, so funny! Especially Dori. I love it when Dori and Marlin first meet and he's following her and she's like what's your problem huh buddy? Is the ocean not big enough for ya! You wanna fight me? Do ya do ya do ya aw yeah I'm scared now!</p><hr><p><b>Beady</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine.  And he shall be my Squishy."</p><hr><p><b>lacy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movies even though I'm 15. It makes me laugh every time. Dory is my favorite character mostly because of her memory loss. I love when she thinks she can speak/understand whale and says "I think he said he wants us to go to the back of the throat... or he wants a root beer float". Of COURSE he wants us to go there! That's EATING us!</p><hr><p><b>Becky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Finding Nemo is an awesome movie. I love it! I love Dory she is really cool. Especially when she speaks whale and Marline dosnt believe her, then at the end he says thank you in whale and Dory says "wow you speak whale, I wish I could speak whale!".</p><hr><p><b>CarmenValentine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Nemo is the best movie in the world, but it would have been better if I was Dory because she acts just like me!</p><hr><p><b>Nemo</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I come to the real world to be captured? What crap!</p><hr><p><b>i love tim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The absolute best and funniest movie ever!</p><hr><p><b>lauren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my favorite movies of all time!</p><hr><p><b>Lou</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so brilliant! I remember seeing it at the cinema and I was amazed at the great graphics. The fish look real. My fave character is Dory, so funny! I definitely need to watch this again. I love reading the script.</p><hr><p><b>N!Ce</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Simply awesome movie, a must-see.


.</p><hr><p><b>Julia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie! It's so funny and greatly written. If you haven't seen it yet, you missed out on one of the greatest movies ever.</p><hr><p><b>omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing pixar film. The company just keeps on scoring animated blockbusters. But monsters inc was better. They should have really put that script on this site.</p><hr><p><b>Marlin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Marlin is the best character in the whole movie. He is so cute! His pictures are so adorable. His smile is also cute.</p><hr><p><b>Michoy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Whoever does not give this a ten, has some serious thrill issues dude. This movie kicks a**! I love Dory ('cause she's like me) and Squirt, so like, DUDE! The whole cast was awesome though, Crush was awesome. So, if you don't like this movie, get over yourself and grow up.</p><hr><p><b>ELLIE</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite part is when dory says "I shall call him squishy, and he shall be mine and he shall be my squishy".</p><hr><p><b>A</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic movie, well written and produced. However, created more for the young at heart and not so much a truly family movie.</p><hr><p><b>Todd Lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so adorable. I love Sqirt and the little jellyfish (forgot his name). "You guys made me ink." Adorable.  I adore Dory, her swimming song is hilarious. I love when she forgets things. "What is your problem, what, is the ocean not big enough for ya buddy?" However that line goes. Haha. Nemo is so sweet.</p><hr><p><b>Staceppa</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Very nice, I have to admit my favorite character is the Shark, I dislike Dori because of the actress that impersonates her voice, I'm not  a dyke fan, and the little turtle does nothing for me, probably he needs some Ritalin for his ADD, who knows he might go into a killing frenzy and exterminates the entire batch. Good movie beside the few glitches.</p><hr><p><b>Marie&Terri</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>All in all, a cute little film, though the little Squirt character was ugly and a persistent pain in the neck.</p><hr><p><b>Chloe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the contrast between Marlin and Dory at the beginning of the movie. It's amazing how he starts to loosen up and goes from the lamest dad-fish-dude to the coolest-dad-fish-dude. There are so many memorable lines in this movie that it's hard to believe it's an animated film. I love when Bruce gets a smell of Dory's blood and then you can see his pupils dilate. The animation is spectaular. The water especially when they go to look around in Sydney, it was so realistic.</p><hr><p><b>Josie</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Isn't a script supposed to include what the characters are doing and set the scene?! Well done with the speech but that is not the only part of a script.</p><hr><p><b>chlo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my god I just love dory, my family loved her so much we named our sharpay dory!</p><hr><p><b>michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>All I ask for is one simple thing, the address to where marlin and dory are going and I can find it. Other than that squirt is SO CUTE.</p><hr><p><b>dory</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie as a kid. It's lost some luster as I read this as a teenager, but it's still good (of course, I've fallen in love with other Pixar movies though). The primary reason for the low rating is the fact that I tried to find the shark scene in the script. But this script. It's just dialogue! No scene headings, actions, shots, nothing of the sort! Really made me a little sad.</p><hr></td>
