    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Casey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>you know they say squels suck. this one dont.</p><hr><p><b>nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>scream is not scary enought.he is a human, and he just want to kill everyone, it doesnt work.and those people who we thought dead, are now resurrected...</p><hr><p><b>KC</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The sequel is good 'cause it questions what is our reality. The fear that your bestfriend would want to kill is enough to make the movie question. Within all the Scream movies it was well presevered when you wonder who do you trust.</p><hr><p><b>Jose</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is not as good as the first one because Randy dies, but what the hell! It still is a good movie.</p><hr><p><b>randymeeksfan24/7</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>This script is not the same as the movie. And for nick, in the movie for scream 1 Dewey wasn't dead he was just unconscious. The ambulance came and took him to the hospital. I like the movie better than the script. The script is all wrong. In the movie Mickey and Debbie Salt are the killers and Joel is Gale's camerman (not Randy). It is like they switched Randy and Joel's roles.</p><hr><p><b>Dicky</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was awesome. Randy dies and I hate that. And it would have been better if they kept Matthew Lillard (Stu) alive so he could come back as the killer or maybe even a victim this time around.</p><hr><p><b>sidney</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>This movie wasn't even close to being as good as the first one.</p><hr><p><b>Courtney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. I love all of the Scream movies. It has inspired me to major in telecommunication and film.</p><hr><p><b>Jenni</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie but undoubtedly not as good as the first. But then again they do say sequels suck which is true, but I think that Scream 2 has proved that not ALL sequels suck. I wish Randy didn't die but oh well. Very good ending to the movie pretty unpredictable and had a good twist. Well done Wes and Kevin!</p><hr><p><b>Jonny</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I really like the movie. I hated that Randy got killed off and didn't have a bigger role in this one than in the first. Maybe Randy and Sidney could've gotten together in the end.</p><hr><p><b>Sadhu</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This movie rules! Many people say that sequels suck. Especially when involved in horror movies. But this sequel is truly amazing. It has a lot more thrills than it's predecessor. It is SCARY! With laughs and chills, "Scream 2" is possibly one of the best sequels ever made.</p><hr><p><b>Kris</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This screenplay is not nearly as good as the finished film. It's completely switched as Mickey and Mrs. Loomis are the killers, but in this script it's Derek and Hallie, then Mrs. Loomis, then Cotton? What the. Still a good read.</p><hr><p><b>Zach</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I wish they hadn't made randy die because he was a person in the movie that would die saving someone. I would not have randy die but if he had to die I would make him die near the end of the movie or would not have put him in the movie at all. Otherwise the movie was great.</p><hr><p><b>Ferris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's not that the scripts are wrong it's just that re-writes were made for the movie that weren't in the original script that was written. Such as Dewey being unconscious in the first movie. In the original he was dead, but Wes Craven decided during production that they couldn't kill his character off because there was too much of an emotional attachment with the audience so they quickly filmed a scene of the ambulance taking him away.</p><hr><p><b>heidi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>All of the screams are classic. They question the horror genre itself and brings I into the movie. The killer is original because it brings that mysterious element about never knowing who the killer is. It constantly leaves you wondering "who is it?" this was a good sequel. I love all of the screams.</p><hr><p><b>ghostface</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If I was to change it randy and Micky would survive along with sid dewy and gale and the killers would be Debbie salt and cotton.</p><hr><p><b>trixrforkids</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is an awesome satire. And people should realize it's a satire. Because it's a much better satire than it is a horror film.</p><hr><p><b>Kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>It's a shame this script leaked and they had to change so much. After reading all 4 scripts for this franchise it's really too bad when you think how great all 4 films could have been.</p><hr><p><b>Nadine</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I thought that the script could have been at least a little bit more effort in to making it sense and all, and making sure that it sounds like the movie that's all i'm trying to say.</p><hr><p><b>Monica</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I'm actually kind of glad the original was leaked on the Internet. The movie version I like more 'cause there are less killers and Mickey was a good psycho (though his motive was kind of ridiculous I must admit) and Mrs Loonies was good, too. But this original script had some good things like Sidney and Cotton scenes and the complexity of Gale and Dewey ans their relationship.</p><hr><p><b>sebastian</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I like how the killer used Sidney's history to trick her.</p><hr><p><b>liz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For all the people bitching that these scripts are wrong, they are the original scripts written before the ones used for the movie.</p><hr><p><b>211of211</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I like this script, and love how Derek and Hallie were the killers. I just wish Cotton hadn't flipped at the end. That was one twist too far for me. I like how in the movie Cotton got to be the hero at the end, after being wrongly accussed and imprisoned in the 1st one. I was hoping the script would end that way. Also, everyone died in this script. That I didn't agree with. Still a good read though. All and all, I liked this better than the movie, but would have preferred Cotton not turn evil at the end.</p><hr><p><b>macspoon</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This was the original script and ideas before they got leaked. That is why they changed things around and we have what we have. The movie is still good, but had this script not gotten leaked back then, it would've been better.</p><hr><p><b>blastvortex</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Well, I can't say that it wasn't a good thing the original script got leaked. I liked the direction, but having another bad BF as one of the villains is too hackneyed. The way it worked out in the movie actually makes a lot more sense, and without a doubt more feasible. I do think Cotton taking a turn would have made the movie more interesting, but the way it was done in-script leaves a tacked-on, stretching-for-it impression. The one thing I did greatly appreciate is the "they all die anyway" ending. Unfortunately, most people don't, so it probably would've been changed anyway. *shrug*.</p><hr><p><b>3TH</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The movie was, to me, better than the first one. Even with that Leak-rewrite thing going on. This one was more of a Craven. While the first was almost williamson. It walks the thin line between fiction and reality constantly with perfect balance, and relays that tension and themes through more of a visual means. Climax gave me 5 orgasms. I love Mickey(Good performance) and Mrs. Loomis(Old-fashioned revenge mommy fits ancient Greek play setups). Original seems to be a bit out of tone. And using Cotton Weary as bad guy just seems too harsh. I 've had lots of sympathy for the guy since the first movie came out. It feels really satisfying watching him get what he wants. But Kevin my man, Killing off Randy was NOT COOL.</p><hr></td>
