    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>nathan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Kick ass film, got to see third one!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>raye</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The script is so different to the movie. It's like a missing chapter. It's worth reading if you're a fan. The extra parts are entertaining too!</p><hr><p><b>Jeff</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>George Romero did not write this movie.</p><hr><p><b>mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Romero didn't write the one that actually came out, but he was the original writer before hand. Then they got W.S. Anderson. While the movies released were entertaining I really would have loved to see this script hit the big screen.</p><hr><p><b>Maud</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>My first impression of that script was, that it played between the two movies (explaining for example where Jill Valentine got the experience how to handle the Zombies). But eventually, I felt like both of the resident evil films were based on this script. On the one hand, there is the underground-lab, which is in some way connected to some small house outside. Furthermore, while the reason for the outbreak itself seems to have not been mentioned here, there's of course once again a 'bad guy' who wants to make profit with the stuff from the lab. RE2-similarities are probably fewer - Tyrant&Nemesis, the (atom-)bomb destroying everything, and perhaps even the S.T.A.R.S.-Team. I don't know if anybody felt similar, but when the "giant plant" was mentioned and described in the script, it sounded very much like HalfLife.</p><hr><p><b>taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best!</p><hr><p><b>Kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script was the original script for the movie until they decided to write a new one.  They scrapped it into the production stage and started over anew with the new script (the one with Milla Jovavich).  I personally think they should have kept with this one as it not only sounds better than the  movie released, but it stayed truer to the game.  I liked the incorporation of all the monsters: zombies, ravens, dogs, hunters, Tyrant, Plant 42, etc. which the released movie didn't even think about putting in there.  The released movie had the brain monsters from the RE2 game, but didn't even seem remotely connected to the first game IMHO.  This is one of the reasons, I think, that video game movies fail.  They become so disconnected from the games they are portraying that it SUCKS!  This script rocks.  They should have stuck with it.  Crap on the desire to turn survival horror into an action movie.  That's not the point.  Survival horror isn't about being proactive, but about being reactive.  The movie they released lost sight of that and turned sour (though it was a good action movie).  Pooey to the released movie, two thumbs up to this script.</p><hr><p><b>Bronner</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The would be the greatest video game adaptation of all time, if only they had kept good old George Romero on board the project but noooo... at least once Resident Evil Extinction is over and done with they're thinking of letting GAR remake the first one (Just a rumor).</p><hr><p><b>marie-jo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That movie and the script is out of damn control!</p><hr><p><b>Bob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The third movie is supposed to have potential, but what about Albert Wesker and Leon S.Kennedy? I thought they're going to be in the movie, I know for a fact that Sony bought the rights for Wesker to be in the film. I think Vin Diesel (Pitch Black, Chronicles of Riddick and xXx) should be Wesker though. Would have preferred Michael Biehn if he was a few years younger.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>First of all, I'll say that this script is vastly superior to the real Resident Evil movie. I really like how Romero incorporates all of the game's coolest creatures (I would love to see the Plant 42 scene in a movie). The zombies in this script were scarier too, because they only attacked in small groups (staying true to the game), which lets you see them up close in gruesome detail. The movie's plot stays relatively close to the original game, and as a result, it's much more compelling. However, most of the changes to the plot Romero made were bad. The descision to make Chris and Jill lovers, and Chris not being part of S.T.A.R.S. was a stupid one. It didn't add anything. I also think he ruined the ending. But apart from those blemishes, what we've got here is a fun and exciting RE movie that I wish they made.</p><hr><p><b>GEMIL</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THIS SCRIPT TOTALLY HUMILIATES THE ONE THAT WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCED! It's not exactly like the game, but it does a fantastic job of reworking the story. This script needs to be produced! The original game was remade, and it's time to remake the move... with this script.</p><hr><p><b>Helen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What were capcom doing, scrapping this revision and going with that annoying tosh that Anderson came up with? This script actually follows the game! It has the game's characters and monsters. When are they going to realize that this is what the fans want, not just a heavy metal soundtrack that does nothing but just deafen the audience. Bring back Romero!</p><hr><p><b>#1 fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The filming started about three months ago I think and is set to some out on September 7, 2007.</p><hr><p><b>Leon S. Kennedy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Man George rocks, were Capcom and Sony high when they turned down this script? In 10 years if the franchise is still popular and profitable, I hope someone comes along, if not George himself, and re-boots the movie franchise and uses this script. If Georgey dies by then well, can a zombie direct?</p><hr><p><b>Dirtcreature</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Wouldn't it be great if someone made a film based on the game? I was very disappointed with the first two films. Claire Danes as Jill Valentine and Chris Evans as Chris Redfield. Wouldn't that be better?</p><hr><p><b>Overbearing and Obnoxious</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Damn straight.</p><hr><p><b>Melissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Kevin. This script was very well-done, and much more of a "horror" movie (well, it's still kind of action-y) than the movie they ended up making. I mean, c'mon, plants coming out of the effing walls? That's a bit more disturbing than, "I shot her in the leg and she's still coming! Oh no3s, she must be a zombie!". Not to mention, this script was truer to the game. One of the faults the RE movie is well-known for is the robotic characters. They have no personality, nothing interesting about them. This script does a much better job at letting you get to know the characters, though a few of the S.T.A.R.S. members did fall flat (they also happened to be the ones that were eaten first, so they didn't get much time to become interesting). I didn't really know the actors Dirtcreature suggested, so I Googled them. At first, Claire Danes looked a little too cutesy to me to play Jill. She looked more like she could play Leelo, from The Fifth Element. However, when I saw another picture I agree, she really looks remarkably like Jill, so far as facial structure goes. Does anyone know if she could, acting wise, play the part of Jill? I don't think I've seen any of her movies. Chris Evans also looks insanely like Chris Redfield. Cool. Anyone have ideas as to who could play Wesker, Ada, Rebecca, or any of the others?</p><hr><p><b>B-dup</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow is all I have to say. They made a mistake not making this into a film.</p><hr><p><b>Giancarlos</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I would say that the movie could have been the best with that script that legendary zombie movie specialist George Romero made. If Paul W. S. Anderson did not interfere with his corny script using Milla and his pointless and overrated kung fu and Matrix style moves the movie would have been very successful.</p><hr><p><b>T.J. Williams</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie. This version is totally kick-ass! I really wish they would've used this one instead. It's much better.</p><hr><p><b>KyleDK</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Paul Anderson is a freakin tool, the only good movie he had was Event Horizon. He needs to be banned from making any more films. He's currently working on Castlevania. Another Great game probably going to be crappy. If Romero had done this movie franchise it would have been so much better. Down with Anderson and up with Romero.</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I tell you I am so disappointed at Sony because I remember when I first heard they're making a resident evil film, I felt so happy because I've wanted to see a film adaption of the game since day one. Then I realized it was totally different, and I was very angry for that. This script was the kind of script I wanted to see for this film when I first heard it was coming out. Now I bet Sony realizes how much of a mistake they made.</p><hr><p><b>Cyberpunk2077</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>All I can say is Capcom and the producers of the Resident Evil movies were out of their damn minds when they turned down Goerge A. Romero's script. They waste the man's time by asking him to write the script to begin with and he writes them the "Citizen Kane" of Horror films. I will never understand these Hollywood studios most of the time. The same injustice has been done to geniuses like Joss Whedon in regards to his Wonder Woman script and earlier work he has done for the first X-Men film.</p><hr><p><b>Kendra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. All the other zombie movies are pretty boring!</p><hr><p><b>Calle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script was like a whole different movie. I would love to see this one being made.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Sam, the monsters were totally cool (other than the fact that he called the chimeras hunters!), and of course it is great that he stuck to the core plot of RE but the characters themselves sucked: Jill & Chris as lovers, Barry a black man, Chris not a part of S.T.A.R.S., Wesker with Forest Speyer's tattoo. I liked Aiken and his buddy though. They really could have fixed this script up and made it into an incredible movie; much better than that disgraceful nemesis-battle crap.</p><hr><p><b>adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Personally, I hated both the 1st and 2nd movie. Call me crazy but let's face facts, these 2 movies were horrendous and give resident evil a bad name. I'm sure that Shinji Makami (if he were dead) would be rolling over in his grave. It's sad when after 8 or so years of rumors, that it's going to be what TRUE fans really want to see, the filmmakers go WAY OUT of their way to butcher a title like this. People that make garbage like this should be hung out on a tree.</p><hr><p><b>Josh Clark</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the original script that George A Remano wrote and the executive producer said he didn't like it and threw it out. With that piece of garbage that Paul WS Anderson did and now turned an epic story of survival into an action piece of shit. Paul if you read this you disappoint me and that blind Bernd Eichinger, how dare you throw this script away like a piece of waste. Well I've done my flaming for short you got a problem hit me up. Peace.</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I personally didn't like romero's script. How did he come up with the idea of making chris and berry black? And to top it off chris is a farmer. That's why I'm giving the script one star, but the movie gets 10 stars.</p><hr><p><b>Martyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I agree that this script makes anderson's look like soiled pants. At least this script didn't have new characters in it. I mean, why do you need a new character called alice when there are loads to choose from already, even if you are just using the name. I also agree that the changes to the plot that romero made, e.g Chris and jill together, big black man barry and native american mohawk chris no stars member man. Some of the dialogue was cheesy though, but still better than the movies. I can EASILY wait for the third movie *shudders*.</p><hr><p><b>Wade</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry, but I just am not satisfied with this script. Sure, it follows the basic game, but come on. Barry can't be black. Chris and Jill are not lovers, (though slight hinting I can understand), Chris is not a farmer, and Wesker does not have a tattoo. It's not bad, but it simply changes way too many things that almost make it un Resident evil-ish. I'm not saying that Anderson's is any better, but come on. I need to make a real Resident Evil movie.</p><hr><p><b>Jim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The reason the script is soo different is because they accepted Paul W. S. Andreson's script and left George A Romero in the dust. But the movie is AWESOME!</p><hr><p><b>evesparza</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I liked this script, is more like the game. Bad Things: Ada, she isn't supposed to be seen until RE2. Wesker is dead,  I mean.. c'mon! How the hell could Wesker die in the first RE movie? Brad Vickers has to be alive [to be killed by Nemesis]. It isn't supposed that Ada and Wesker were allies? [if Wesker dies here, how he's gonna order Ada to get a Parasite?]. There's so many things I didn't like, but I liked because it's a RE Movie. Now, talking about the RE Movies (Ground Zero, Apocalypse & Extinction) I think is a good idea to introduce a new character, otherwise, the movies will be something that everyone knows. The story, the end, and for many of us will be kind of bored seeing in the movie what you're playing since years ago. Introducing Alice as a main character, is "Fresh Air" to the Saga. The rumours said this 3rd one is the last of Alice's Saga, but a 4th is already confirmed. I hope this could be true.</p><hr><p><b>Decker</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script was amazing. There were a few changes that didn't really make sense like Chris being native American and not a stars member, but it was still so damn good. Paul Whatta Shithead (W.S.) Anderson really knows how to screw up a movie. Romero is the godfather of zombie movies and this movie would have rocked had Sony and Capcom not been so stupid. Capcom bitched about the changes Romero made but look at Anderson's piece of shit, the only thing it has in common with the resident evil game is that it's a zombie movie. Anderson didn't keep anything from the game, Anderson spat on the great name of Resident Evil, and he along with Capcom spat upon all of the fans. It seriously sucks to think what a brilliant movie we could've had if the dumb asses at Capcom hadn't fired Romero. It makes me so mad. Are you listening Capcom, Sony, you bunch of hacks. Get off your asses, get in touch with the genius himself George A. Romero and get this shit going, make a couple small changes to the script if you're not happy how he changed Chris, it's not that hard to change a script is it? Give the fans what they deserve, the real Resident Evil. The movie that should have been made with the script by George Romero. They did it with batman begins, you can do it with Resident Evil. End this series with Paul WS Anderson and Milla Jovovich, start over and bring in Romero. Please, do it for the fans, you will not regret it, and we will get the true Resident Evil movie we all want and deserve.</p><hr><p><b>Paul</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br> Man i just got done reading the script and i must say that i am pissed. This would have been the godfather of video game films, but no the rich suits who just want to get more rich could care less about the game, and don't give a shit about us gamers who truly wanted this movie to be what it should have been. Hire a director like paul anderson who basically is just as bad as uwe boll to make the mess that he did. George if you read this I have to say that your script for resident evil was even better then my expectations! Well done, and please let this script somehow come to life like it deserves!</p><hr><p><b>Ed Sigma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolute fan of Dawn of the Dead that I am, I was astounded and angry to find out that Romero was booted of the Resident Evil movie, and it was handed to a director who is most notable for taking stories with great basic premises, and making with them films that are cavalcades of mediocrity or worse.  Now I've read this script, I'm even more pissed about this, this script is awesome!  It's superior in almost every way to the finished movie, and in many ways the actual game, which personally I think was somewhat over-rated (though RE4 is great!), but it did have good movie potential.  The characterisation is good, not great, but at least everyone actually has a personality in this one and the storyline is close to the game while actually making a lot more sense and not having, to quote games reviewer Yahtzee "dialogue that sound like it was written by a twelve year old ADD sufferer locked in a room with a pile of Buffy comic books".  Also, a major plus on the finished movie is the use and screentime of almost all the major creatures from the game (with the exception of the giant spider, but that probably would have been over egging the pudding, so to speak), which would have given a good range and variety of stuff on screen, and a nice rich helping of gore gags too (something the movies badly needed).  Overall, this one is miles better than what we got, it's no Oscar winner, but compared to the quality of writing of the movie franchise, and indeed the games themselves, it's like comparing the works of Shakespeare to the works of a forum for Sailor Moon Fan Fiction.  I still wonder why this one wasn't picked up though, maybe it had something to do with the changes from the game alienating the die-hard fans (which is a stupid way to go about it) or maybe it was something to do with Romero's whole "screw the system and authority" attitude, but still it's a damn shame.  Maybe in a few years, we could hope for a remake, you never know...</p><hr><p><b>444</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You know, if they restart this movies series of resident evil again, and fire all the previous creator of the RE movies. and give it to someone smart like GAR, and bring the real RE to the movies... I can love RE again. It's very painful what the movies have done. I love the RE games and the movies was like, it hanged me, it completely alienated and disrupted the circle of life. Capcom and the people who made the games, please remake the RE movies franchise and fix what has gone wrong. So angry that a legend like RE was destroyed, just like all legends.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Capcom rejecting this scrip from Romero is like going to heaven and slapping the gate keeper in the face.. you just don't do that. The only bite I have with this script is the fact that Chris isn't a stars member, other than that it was really true to form. Maybe an anime company can pick it up. If not, when I get into power in Hollywood this will get made!</p><hr><p><b>V</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script itself is ten times better then that shit that paul anderson put out. The way the characters were written was new and refreshing for the series and i liked the tense relationship between chris and jill. It's something that every fan has imagined since 1996, so overall good job and this is the one that should have been made.</p><hr><p><b>devon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script is better than anything the studio ever put out. The trilogy is one of the worst horror movie franchises and or video game movie adaptions I have ever seen. But this... this is amazing. Romaro is a god screenwriter and his artistic views should be fully realized in every instance of his work but alas he is always, ALWAYS held back by the suits in Hollywood. I would have been one happy fan if his script would have been made and not the one written by worst person in Hollywood (Paul W.S. Anderson). He has ruined almost every video game movie for me!</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>George A Romero's script was perfect! Paul Anderson's was just HORRIBLE, as it derives itself completely from the games. As for the cast if a remake was made, here's how it should be: Chris Redfield - Chris Evans. Jill Valentine - Claire Danes. Albert Wesker - Robert Patrick. As for the other characters, I'm not sure who could play them.</p><hr><p><b>PE</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>WOW I just finished reading the script and am so excited its as if it were coming out. If I had the money I would make this a film but I don't. I enjoyed the original but this is a different movie. And I really like it. I was watching this in my head as I read it. I tell you I enjoyed this movie a lot it was amazing. I have played Resident Evil original and Resident Evil outbreak file 2. Having read this screen play/ script my mind has made this a movie playing again and agin in my head. I have so many ideas on how to make the scenes how the sets should might look. I have not made a motion picture before but I have a creative mind, I'm good with computers, I have studied and learned a lot about the entire film process including computers, editing, special effects and love it all. I am serious about this if I can help make this a movie I sure really want to. Please E-mail me if interested.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well I finished reading the script and I really enjoyed it. It was a bit truer to the games than the 2002 release but similar. I enjoyed both the script and the released movie but I hope that this script gets made into a movie one day. I give it 10 S. T. A. R. S. An excellent script and must read for Resident Evil fans.</p><hr><p><b>Devlin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Movie was AWESOME! A lot like the games (3 nemesis and 2). And for the dude who said Barry can't be black, it wasn't him, and Chris isn't in the movie it was Carlos.</p><hr><p><b>Magooface</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>The Resident Evil movie series is an abomination. I remember playing the games when I was in graduate school and actually being scared. I thought it was pretty incredible that a video game could have your heart pounding like that. So imagine my disappointment when I watched the movies and they were like a cross between Flight of the Living Dead and The Sixth Sense. It's really a shame too because the ideas in the game sell themselves. They could've literally cut and pasted a movie that would've been truly scary.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>It's alright and this is an original story based off the game so they could do whatever they wanted with it as long as they gave credit to capcom. But overall the dialogue was cheesy and some points in this script were unnecessary, much like the regular films Anderson came up with so it wouldn't even matter. But I do like the creativity they used with Ada, though I prefer her as a bad ass spy.</p><hr><p><b>jungles</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It's a great movie yes but the first film would be better if they remake it with all the same actors, the CGI was a let down.</p><hr><p><b>ViperFilmz</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This script is better than Anderson's piece of crap. Everything about this script is GREAT.</p><hr><p><b>anoymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Its needs to be rebooted right away because it ended up like a piece of trash not even based on a video game more like mix mash of what other movies done which is not cool by any means and alice piece of trash has to be removed. The reboot has to be done by someone who know the games not by Anderson who do it even try to follow the videogame.</p><hr><p><b>rambobew</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>What have you been up to? I am fascinated about covid19. Can you talk about it? If the same thread is opened please redirect my post. Thanks. PS: I don't know any people with covid and you? Rambo :D.</p><hr></td>
