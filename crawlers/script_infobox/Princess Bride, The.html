This movie will be loved by mostly all generations.</p><hr><p><b>cody</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sweet I love this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Buttercup</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Classic!</p><hr><p><b>Gem</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film, it rocks! Completely underrated, should have been bigger than it was.</p><hr><p><b>i</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely one of the best movies of all time! Inconceivable you say? Well you're wrong. Best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Fan Of Cary Elwes</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. It is my fave movie of all time!</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favorite movies. Every time I see it I laugh even harder. It is also a great movie to get quotes from. Anyone who doesn't like this movie is crazy, and anyone who hasn't seen this movie is even crazier!</p><hr><p><b>Rayna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mawage. Mawage es what bwing us togever today. And wove, twoo wove. OK, sorry. This is an AWESOME movie! Maybe even better then Robin Hood Men in Tights or Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Very funny, I recommend it.</p><hr><p><b>Tynan`</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of the all time greats, it has a 100% rewatchability rate. True beauty!</p><hr><p><b>Sixx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Uni. You have no soul. Either that, or the plot was just too deep for you to comprehend. This is one of the all time classic movies ever made. I bet Uni didn't catch any of the redundancies in that last statement, nor the irony that exists by calling The Princess Bride "OK". This is a great movie. Period. If you don't like it, you should take that as a reason to seek out mental therapy. Obviously, there must be something wrong with your synapses. My bet is constant misfires caused by neural blockage or severe localized damage in both the cognative reasoning and the pleasure centers of your brain. Ask your doctor about medications that may reduce scarring of the brain tissues.</p><hr><p><b>raechal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is 1 of my fave movies ever. It has a good balance of fighting and romance. It is a really brill film and I agree with sixx if you don't like it, seek professional help. It is a classic.</p><hr><p><b>pinklover787</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great film, some bits soppy.</p><hr><p><b>Chuck</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Okay. Witty and hilarious script. A tired, overused plot line completely refreshed. What is there not to love?</p><hr><p><b>Me</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love that movie. I can quote the whole thing I have seen it so many times!</p><hr><p><b>Megan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie! I've only watched it a few times but already it has to be one of my favorite, favorite movies to watch in the whole world! Whoever has not seen it: this movie is a must see. Excellent for family fun.</p><hr><p><b>PhotoPro</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Before the movie came out I used to give copies of the book as gifts to people.

Goldman's writing is superb and very rich.

This movie has a little bit of everything in it, and is great for all ages.</p><hr><p><b>Amidala</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely LOVE this movie. My father kept taking about ROUS's, but not telling me what it stood for. I finally watched the movie, and now it is on my top 10 list. Anyone who doesn't like it is out of their mind. With fencing, fighting, death, torture, true love, revenge. It is the perfect movie for the entire family. Even boys.</p><hr><p><b>ZanyPunk</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sixx, this is a movie comment page, not a psychoanalysis of every individual person who comments. I personally LOVE the movie, but just because one person voices an opposing opinion to your own, does not mean you need to tell them to have therapy. It's not like the therapist would diagnose Uni with alexythimia because of their lack of voicing their emotions about a movie. It is a bit harsh for you to say so. A lot of people can use big words, but that doesn't make your opinion any more right than the next persons.</p><hr><p><b>As you wish...</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was an amazing script and movie.  It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and it doesn't get old.  The "IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN" is hilarious!  My friend has a retainer and we always tease her because she sounds like him.  She says the lines perfectly!  Whenever we get board we just find ourselves going "anybody want a peanut," and such...  </p><hr><p><b>Harrysmum</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'll tell you why this movie is so good, because on a day when my son is bored and at his dad's and missing me, we text each other lines from the script- which he has memorised- and laugh all morning. Great movie.</p><hr><p><b>RowenaBryardie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Man, between me, my sister, and my husband, we can pretty much recite this entire move! It was a huge facet of my childhood.</p><hr><p><b>The Albino</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Uni. The idea that this movie is a simple 5 out of 10 on the star scale is absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, Inconceivable. To you I say BOOO, the queen (or king) of slime, filth and putrescence. You should know, never to go in against Princess Bride fans when dignity is on the line. This movie is one of, if not the greatest movie of all time. Maybe the problem with you is that you took it too seriously. The film is, generically speaking, a brilliant parody of the entire fantasy/fairy tale genre. It contains all the fantastical characters that you think you've seen before, but never actually seen. The script is genius all the way through combining simplicity with humor with complexity and quotability. I am not ashamed to admit an ability to quote 1/2 to 3/4 of the movie word for word (my friends and family have to duct tape my mouth shut). So yes, my only regret is that I have but 10 stars to give.</p><hr><p><b>Inconceivable!</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie!. But I never rate anything 10. That would mean it was perfect, and that's just impossible. Sixx, I just want to let you know, but your comments toward Uni came across quite rude. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and there is no right or wrong answer. Basically calling them crazy-insane-mentally unstable-downright stupid is not allowing them to have their own opinion. To help you understand what I'm saying, try to put yourself in their shoes. I mean really place yourself in their shoes. Don't just shrug it off saying you wouldn't care, try to imagine what it would be like to be told that you needed therapy just because you had a different opinion than someone else. I think you'll find that it's not so harmless after all. Just saying.</p><hr><p><b>Destiny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie. Andrew, I totally agree with you on the quotes thing. When my sister and I were little, my grandma used to quote the rhyming scene near the beginning when we would rhyme our words. It was always one of my favorite movies when I was younger, and remains one of my favorite comedies today.</p><hr><p><b>danielpauldavis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The quality of a movie is easily seen by the number of its lines that have entered the culture's language and/or are referenced in its entertainment. This and that other William Goldman script "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," are at the top. 'Nuff said.</p><hr></td>
