    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>PETER AVERY</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I've just read the script "a few good men", it is almost word for word as the movie, one I have seen numerous times. I love this script. It has everything in it, drama, tension, murder, blackmail,etc. I can relate to Jack Nicholson as Jessop and Demi Moore as Gallaway, but I couldn't stand Tom Cruise as Kaffee. Anyone but him. He took the role of Kaffee and turned it into every other role he has taken - sub standard. The script is fast paced and exciting.</p><hr><p><b>natalia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I personally loved that film, which I saw four times. In my personal (not universal) opinion, Tom Cruise did Kaffee's role very well, but, in spite of being a fan of him, I must accept, gladly of course, that Jack Nicholson was by far the bet actor in the film. He was able to steam up any of the other actors, and that's something completely admirable.</p><hr><p><b>Michael</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great script and a firm grasp of military mind-think (albeit dramatized). Outstanding dialogue. Filmed almost word for word from the screenplay. Nicholson, of course, was brilliantly cast as Col. Jessup with excellent turns by Demi Moore as the officious Lt. Cmdr seeking a professional challenge. Ditto for the supporting cast. However, I disagree with some regarding the casting of Tom Cruise. I think that he was perfect for the part and played it beautifully. Self assured to the point of nauseating cockiness, spoiled and unmotivated but keenly intelligent and aware. And I accept the epiphany that he experienced as he got into the case and became a real advocate for his clients rather than just spin his wheels while he waited for his mandatory service to end and he could go out and leverage his family connections for a big buck corporate job somewhere. Very, very good movie propelled by a GREAT script.</p><hr><p><b>Avi</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love the script and I love the movie. All actors were brilliantly cast especially Kaffee, Jessup and Kendrix.</p><hr><p><b>steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Great script! It's interesting to note that the entire final scene didn't make the movie. The movie ends in the courtroom, with Cruise the only person left in it. Frankly I read it mainly because I've seen the movie for at least the 4th time, but I swear, I still can't make out exactly what Cruise says to Kevin Bacon in the very last scene. I discovered it was: "And very handsome, too, don't you think?" Cruise mumbled it. I wonder how many takes Rob Reiner made him do. This film might be the third most-repeated movie ever on AMC, behind The Godfather and Patton! And there was one further showing of it on yet another channel just tonight. I'm hooked every time I watch it. It's a Nicholson classic. I can't say enough about him.</p><hr><p><b>Reuben</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great script. I love the movie with cruise, all actors are super brilliant, especially Kendrix.</p><hr><p><b>Jeff</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely love this movie. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he is perfect in this (and in, "The Firm,") in my opinion. The cast is all incredible; from Jack Nicholson, all the way down to in the best character actor of our time, the late J. T. Walsh (Markison). Like Steve (above), I couldn't make out what Cruise said to kevin Bacon, in the final scene. I could swear the word, "it," came out of his mouth and still don't hear, "very handsome," as the script implies. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I'm also glad that Rob Reiner decided to cut the final, "date scene," between Cruise and Moore, as it was was completely unnecessary, as I heard him say in a documentary. Great call, Rob. The one puzzling thing is I had heard Mr. Reiner correctly say in an earlier documentary that the marines in uniform were played by the Texas A&M Corp. Of Cadets. However, in the latest DVD version, he says the marines were played by, "some cadets from North Carolina." Strange that he forgot this, as the credits correctly state that it was the Texas A&M corp. They did a great job. Kudos to all involved, Aaron Sorkin on down, for this great classic. I've loved, "Meathead," since his, "All in the Family," days, and Reiner never disappoints. My second favorite of his is, "Misery." Interesting that the guy who played Harold Dawson worked with Reiner on the set of, "Misery." What a great job Wolfgang Bodison did, playing Dawson; especially since he had never acted before. Thanks to Mr. Reiner for making us aware of this.</p><hr><p><b>Lynx</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Great script, nice story and nice dialogues. Can't wait to see the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Philippe G. Bernard</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script does not match the closing moments. In the movie and in response to his fellow defendant who asks, "What did we do wrong?" Dawson answers, "we forgot to defend those who cannot defend themselves. Willie couldn't defend himself!".</p><hr><p><b>Keith</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I still believe Kaffee is saying "Added SOMETHING to it, don't you think?".</p><hr><p><b>JL</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Tom Cruise played Tom Cruise- the same role he plays in every movie he appears in. Demi Moore was only marginally more believable than Cruise, who simply wasn't Jack Nicholson was great, of course Kaffee's character is over the top- this is a movie and not a documentary, but only in Hollywood can a newly minted lawyer/commissioned officer move with such ease Of course, the same script with a real actor in Kaffee's role could produce a performance to equal Nicholson's Moore's role doesn't make sense- or maybe it's that she can't make sense of it All told the defendants- who are charged with a capital crime- are represented by lawyers who have tried a couple of misdemeanors. It strikes me as unlikely that the government would waste the effort that one short trial would take unless the defendants had what would pass for adequate representation Overall- it is a "good" movie only because Nicholson is in it I saw the movie for the first time last night and read the script today.</p><hr><p><b>Harv</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Aaron Sorkin has been my favorite screenwriter for quite some time. Clever, engaging dialogue, interesting character development, attention to detail, and compelling story lines make for exceptional TV episodes and movies. The West Wing, The Newsroom, and A Few Good Men are my favorites from this talented man.</p><hr></td>
