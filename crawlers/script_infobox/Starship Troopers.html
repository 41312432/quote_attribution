    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Jeremy</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This is just a horrible, horrible mess. If only the writer of this had gotten HIS brain sucked out by a giant bug before the studio let him loose on Heinlein....</p><hr><p><b>N.Marshall</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Now, I am a Robert Heinlein fan, but this script is a horribly contstructed bastardization of the novel He wrote. I'm aware that a script writer takes his own view of the book and applies it to a screenplay, as I write a few of them myself. However, I view this to be appalling. It is almost inexcusable the lack of thought that was put into attempting to keep the script somewhat true to the original story. About the only two things that are similar are characters names and the premise for the war. After that, it just becomes a jumbled mass of characters that aren't in the novel, and plot points that never happened. 

I appreciate artistic license, but there's a line that has to be drawn eventually. </p><hr><p><b>Bill</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A brilliant movie! I loved it!</p><hr><p><b>derek</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>If you never read the book this movie is a passable sci-fi adventure flick. If you have read the book you'll see why they waited until Heinlein was safely dead.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It's not Heinlein, but it is brilliant! You have to look at the message!</p><hr><p><b>Conor</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Loved the first Starship Troopers, but the only good thing about this film is the hot woman who gets naked.</p><hr><p><b>ginsu</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This screenplay is not complete. 

This adaptation is perhaps the most brilliant social satire of the 90s. 

If you love dark humor, surrealism and satire then you will appreciate this work. Its a Dr. Strangelove style anti-war reaction to all those bad 80s and 90s sci fi tv shows. 

If youre a sci fi purist looking for a strict adaptation of the novels, perhaps you will have to write that yourself and get some one to produce it. Sucka. Maybe that hobbit dude will hook you up.</p><hr><p><b>SST Fan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My god you guys need to stop comparing this movie with the book and look at it for what it is. Also you know why it's not similar to the book? Well they couldn't afford to use the powersuits and it would've been comical to the normal movie-viewer to see 50 Cap troopers hopping around shooting at the bugs. Also then it would pose the question "WHY DON'T THEY HOVER ALL THE TIME AND KILL THE BUGS FROM THE AIR!". Other than that I loved the movie for what it was. A good sci-fi flick. But I do believe that Rico should've ended up with Dizzy and Carmen should've died (then again that's just me). -"COME ON YOU APES, YOU want to LIVE FOREVER!?!".</p><hr><p><b>cyrusjoebob</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>What a hack job. 
Who the heck is Edward Noomyer and why is it that he only pops his head up like a mole once in a while? I've tried to search for his website, but noooo. Guess he's unable to be a professional. But I recognize his ham handed touch as a common thread of mediocrity throughout his credited work. All his life a hack. Stay under your rock boy.
.</p><hr><p><b>Shrike70</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Horrible bastardization of the original purpose of the book. Heinlein is spinning in his grave. Starship Troopers was a book about Marine Corps (cap troopers are the bullet-stoppers, pilots are the Navy) and general military ethics, the relationship of the military to society, personal and group loyalty, and how the forces of combat and sheer luck combine to cause a young man to mature rapidly. The movie is about high school kids who blithely sign up to go kill CGI monsters, no ethics in sight. It's Dawson's Creek meets Aliens.</p><hr><p><b>BooBoo21</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I haven't read the book, but this movie is one of my favorites. The dark comedy and overall message are timeless. Of course somethings are a little absurd. For example, how can the bugs shoot meteorites towards Earth? I doubt they have maps and obviously don't have machines since they are lowly insects with "ant-like" intelligence. The only possible way is to have a plasma bug randomly shoot and hit one, but that happening is unbelievable, more so that it would hurl exactly towards Earth and no other direction in vast space. Another problem is that if Klendathu is that much of a problem, why not just nuke the hell out of it and blow it to pieces? Humans wouldn't use it once the bugs are gone and even in reality today we could blow up the Earth 8 times over with our nukes. But there are plenty of bright spots! Mr. Rasczak rants and such are awesome in the opening scene! Classic, smart, grim and funny. He is one of the best developed characters! The special effects were amazing for a film of that time period! Everything seemed so real and the arachnids were so scary! This is a great movie, period.</p><hr><p><b>Mano</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>So many of the comments here are hilarious - the subtlety behind the film was clearly missed by many in the beautiful special effects. Though "Dawson's Creek meets Aliens" is perhaps one of the finest compliments that can be paid to the scriptwriter. Science fiction is a great vehicle which has been used here to satirize fascism. It's a brilliantly constructed script - astonishingly well realized in the final movie. I write novels and films and would be delighted to come up with something a quarter this magnificent.</p><hr><p><b>Jazz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No one seems to realize that Neumeier and Verhoeven hated the novel. They saw it as fascist propaganda, so they made a film that satirized that.</p><hr><p><b>EHO</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>We just watched it again and agree with Mano re the satirization of fascism in this movie. It was one of the funniest and most real aspects of the movie, especially in the opening comments about social democracy being an experiment and unwieldy form of government (very paraphrased). Completely right on for today's political world. I loved Neil Patrick Harris in his "SS" role and the scenes of "jabbing" the aliens with every device to figure out their weak spots. Re the characters, "Diz" should have lived, as well as the co-pilot with Carmen- I don't see that their deaths added to the emotional height of the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Loosehead</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>So if Verhoeven and Neumeier hated the novel, why did they make a movie of it? Make your anti-fascist satire out of a fresh story and don't rape a much-admired book, and propagate some unjust and ill-fitting criticism of the book, just to get some buzz for your film. Special effects were pretty impressive all the same, but the characters and story in the film just don't make sense. People here have already noted the absurdity of a bug knocking an asteroid out of orbit to hit earth. I'll just add a couple of questions- how far is the bug planet from earth, and how did an asteroid get here in under a few thousand years? That sort of stuff, and the distortion of the books message, kind of spoiled it for me. If you want to plug some political message, don't steal from a book that carries no such message.</p><hr><p><b>Jim</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>While I haven't read the book, I do love this film. The characters and some things seem a little "odd", but in general, it was damn entertaining. Which is what I would like movies I watch to do: entertain me! Plus, I really enjoy pancakes.</p><hr><p><b>B22</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I haven't read the book but the film is brilliant. Mano explained why, so there's no need to repeat all he said. The film is a satire and objections about bugs shooting meteorites miss the point. Such absurdities (there are plenty in the film) underline the satirical character of the film.</p><hr><p><b>Mat93</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Apparently the only reason why people hate this movie is because it doesn't follow the book. Is there anybody who disliked this movie because of an actual noteworthy reason.?</p><hr><p><b>KEN</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>EHO: For "Diz" you are right but for the co-pilot with Carmen, his death was not contributing to the emotional height of the movie per se because the movie was in its dying moments, it may have been an attempt to show and confirm the intelligence of this aliens as a society: Look at how the bugs captured the two and prepared them for their king to feed on them.</p><hr><p><b>D</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I'm amazed the semi-literates getting all butthurt about the "rape" of Heinlein's novel were able to find time from cooknig meth andm olesting their kids to write their opinions. Or does this webasite have a translator to transcribe their crayon scrawl that they send in? Heinlein was a hack writer and a right-wing nutball. If you think he's a great writer or that his work is "beloved," you really need to be removed from society, or at least prohibited from breeding.</p><hr></td>
