</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best. Movie. Ever.</p><hr><p><b>Jack</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>With your feet in the air and your head on the ground, Try this trick and spin it, yeah. Your head will collapse But there's nothing in it And you'll ask yourself.
Wonderful exposition a novel, great Chuck.
</p><hr><p><b>abby</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is awesome! I love it, I can't take my eyes off it no matter how many times I see it =D. If you haven't seen it go get it, it's a lot more than Brad Pitt without a shirt.</p><hr><p><b>Milo</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>The summer when this was released, The Sixth Sense was in cinemas at the same time. Two movies, two great surprise endings. Well, not for long and not outside my local cinema. Me and a friend had tee-shirts made up reading: "Bruce is dead and Brad is Ed", which we wore during a casual stroll along the queue for each movie on opening night. People's faces were a picture I can tell you. What can I say, we were young(er).</p><hr><p><b>Dorian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great masterpiece, made me think of my perpetual existence.</p><hr><p><b>Vladimir</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic film. Fantastic storyline. A great adventure/thriller scripture. A masterpiece. I definetely thought that Brad and Ed played a great role in this film. Fantastic from the beginning to the end.</p><hr><p><b>ann</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>With enough soap, one could blow up the world. If one were so inclined. I know just about every word to this movie, I absolutely love it.</p><hr><p><b>Angie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"Bruce is dead and Brad is Ed", that's pure evil. Every other line of this entire movie can be quoted (and believe me, it has been). How many of us have used quotes from here as a signature on forums? Great script, brilliantly shot and a joy to read.</p><hr><p><b>Katrina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Script correction: when the narrator is imagining his power animal for the second time, and sees Marla, she says "It's a lie," not "slide". This is a mistake in just about every FIGHT CLUB script online, and in viewers' perceptions. So to those of you who say you can recite the script: erase and replace. your memories are false reports. I've used "paint the walls with my brains" as a signature. Incredible movie. Practically necessary to see at least twice for perspective. Has a dry, satiric kind of humor. Expect a mood swing: apathy with a side of enlightenment.</p><hr><p><b>Will</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Unbelievable, a masterpiece.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Worst film.</p><hr><p><b>Tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best film I have ever seen!</p><hr><p><b>iieuvy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>ONLY the best movie EVER.</p><hr><p><b>sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The scene where Detective Stern calls Jack with more info about the condo is incomplete in this script! What's up with that?</p><hr><p><b>FCF</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome that movie makes you feel alive in a way that's incalculable.</p><hr><p><b>bruce</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No word can tell how good this movie is. David Fincher, Brad and Norton just washed my brain by making this movie, which is not simply a movie any more to me after I've seen it more than 5 times.</p><hr><p><b>Geoff</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing movie overall. Camera work was great, the script was great, the directing was great and the acting was great. One thing though, movies usually change from the original script during filming. Just because it's different in the movie than in the script, doesn't mean the script is wrong. The scripts are put up in their original format.</p><hr><p><b>Paulson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A film that stands a cut above most movies before it and maybe even after it. Excellent script that's sound for sore ears and acting that's a sight for sore eyes. Norton, Pitt and Bonham Carter were made for this film. Quintessential viewing.</p><hr><p><b>Ernie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>An indictment of our manipulative society. Bare truth exposed of what "they" want us to be. Breaks all the rules. A must see at least twice. Once it sinks in, a potentially dangerous actionable "message" against the Status Quo!</p><hr><p><b>tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>All time favorite.</p><hr><p><b>KAENA</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>We are the same organic mater like 
anyone else

.</p><hr><p><b>Sean</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You are all in violation of the rule.</p><hr><p><b>willy the kid</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't want to beat around the bush. I've personally watched this movie more than ten times. Super superb.</p><hr><p><b>ting</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Makes me think more about my life and why I am here.</p><hr><p><b>Krystin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am so obsessed with this movie! Better than the book.</p><hr><p><b>elle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Really great. Lovin' it.</p><hr><p><b>Ace</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Incredible film.</p><hr><p><b>John</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Just about the best thing to ever be made, it turned me on to the book which is even more fantastic, read it!</p><hr><p><b>Hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic film. Makes you think.</p><hr><p><b>Rob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sheer brilliance, this is the greatest movie ever to be produced. It's mind twisting and thrilling, leaving me always speechless.</p><hr><p><b>Patrick</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The narrator is not named "Jack." He does say "I am Jack's__" several times, but he's merely referring to the articles written in first person from the perspective of organs; organs of a person named Jack. Anyway, the movie is great, and the script is nice to have.</p><hr><p><b>Bryce</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No matter how many times you watch this movie, there is always something inspiring to learn from the words of wisdom laced within this masterpiece. My personal favorite ."On a short enough timeline, everyones life expectancy is zero". Great movie, great philosophy, highly recommended.</p><hr><p><b>Ehren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>His name is technically Tyler Durden. But for the script sake, he should be called Narrator, not Jack. Top movie.</p><hr><p><b>harry georgatos</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"Fight Club" is an extremely subversive film that highlights the hypocrisy of our times. It is similar in that respect to "The Graduate". In "The Graduate" it was plastics. In "Fight Club" it's a consumerist society that leads to Edward Norton's schizophrenia and mental breakdown. This is such an ingeniously diabolical film in its plot twists that in the final twenty minutes the audience have been successfully bamboozled. A social and political masterpiece by David Fincher.</p><hr><p><b>farcloud</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Granted, it mostly comes from a book. But, it is still the best movie script ever. It keeps your mind constantly pondering, guessing, solving and laughing.</p><hr><p><b>michael</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Some of the greatest movie quotes of all time. It's at the top of my dvd piles and there it should stay. Thanks david fincher.</p><hr><p><b>Danniel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Actually, the character's name is Jack for script purposes, at least that's what Fincher, Norton, Pitt, and Uhls refer to him as in the directors commentaries.  They said that though he was the narrator, they called him Jack during the movie making process.</p><hr><p><b>Tyler Durden</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Within the Book they make no reference to the name of the Narrator and in the movie no reference is made to his name other than the name "Jack" within the script. In fact the only name that the narrator ever gets called is "Tyler Durden" makes you wonder, was the narrator's name actually Tyler Durden? To answer the few questions that I may receive from this comment. Within the film "Jack" uses a fake and a different name each time he goes to a help group so none of them know his name, Marla only knows him as Tyler Durden. At the end of the film "Jack" says to Tyler "No you have a house you pay bills" to this Tyler simply replies "All under YOUR name". Could it be a stretch to think that the narrators name is in fact Tyler?.....just a thought.</p><hr><p><b>Coho</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The narrator's birth name is quite ambiguous in and of itself. It could be Tyler Durden, but then again, how could he forget his name after 30 years of being called that. It's entirely conceivable that the "Tyler" portion of him, created enough of a physical and legal identity for him to travel around with. (remember this movie was pre-911, airport security was very lax, ID's were merely glanced at if that) So at that point its left up in the air still. Also, someone was saying something about Marla in the cave, yes she did say "slide" unless the official subtitles on the DVD are wrong. But all and all a wonderful piece of film!</p><hr><p><b>Dennis Bey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever made. Maybe not in cinematography, technology wise
(although is not bad at all), but because of the message pummeled through the film about the status quo and existential problems in the deprecatory consumerism era. If you believe everything is fine and dandy, fulfilled and people are happy with the church of ATM (Chris Rock:), well then you don't like it. Otherwise you're going to rave and take many jewels to confirm your feelings and/or enlighten.</p><hr><p><b>Wouter</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I am reading this script now whilst watching the movie and there are a lot of differences. Sometimes the exact wording. Sometimes words are missing, other times the the order of words, sentences or whole paragraphs is different. Are there different versions of the movie or are there just a lot of mistakes in this one?</p><hr><p><b>vegas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@milo what a pathetic sad little person. Who in their right mind would think spoiling two great films is ok?</p><hr></td>
