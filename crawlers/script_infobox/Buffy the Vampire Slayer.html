    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Karen</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Just to let you know -- this is the Buffy with Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry, not the Buffy from TV -- they have the wrong picture up.  Instead of the more drama oriented TV show, this movie is hysterically funny (when you turn off your brain).</p><hr><p><b>allea</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>but joss whedon didn't really write the movie script did he? i thought he didn't... they really should put up a pic that matches wut it is... i was reading it and instantly knew it was the movie but was very confused.</p><hr><p><b>mathew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>that movei sucked. Joss whendons show is the best ever.[other than firefly.]
Im his biggest fan.</p><hr><p><b>emmasi</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favourite movies ever. Despite some of general failings of the era (80s training montage, for example) it mostly hits the spot, for me. Very funny and the characters are all great. 

In reading (what I think) is the original script, it would seem that Pike was meant to be much more like Spike (from TV Buffy) than than he ended up. It's a shame that Joss' character was changed so much, but I do like Pike as he is now. And I got 6 years of Spike after this movie, so I'm not complaining.</p><hr><p><b>Yume-chan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow.This is a great movie ^-^. In fact I think I liked it as much as I did the TV series. Uber-funny and interesting, tres bien!</p><hr><p><b>hilary</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My reason for living life. I'm a slave to Buffy, now and forever!</p><hr><p><b>laura</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Joss Whedon is a genius. Buffy is THE coolest show ever and should have lasted for a few more series at least.</p><hr><p><b>jodie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's the greatest show ever, it's all I ever look forward to doing is watching it. I think that Joss Whedon is a genius as well as all the other writers and actors. It's awesome!</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This script is near perfect.  How did they screw that movie up so bad?  I'm glad Joss got a chance to redeem himself.</p><hr><p><b>Mandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The movie is good. But I liked the ending in the script.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I love Buffy on tv it's my favourite program and was really upset when it finished. Compared to the tv series I didn't think this film was as good. Don't get me wrong, it was good to watch but I think I'll stick to watching the versions with Sarah Michelle Gellar in.</p><hr><p><b>Jo</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Anything Joss Whedon makes is awesome. It was hard for me to adjust to seeing the different actors and sorts of vampires that they use for the movie (since I'm a fan of the series) but still, anything Joss makes I love :)</p><hr><p><b>Katherine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was really good. I think Luke Perry is a hottie. Kristy Swanson is a lucky one to get to kiss him.</p><hr><p><b>Sweetdoggie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie when it came out and it still has a lot of entertainment value.  I thought it was interesting how many things from the film eventually got incorporated into the TV series.  Well worth watching and this script is very good reading.  </p><hr><p><b>Susan</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Buffy the series is absolutely awesome, I'm addicted. The movie is appaling. Cheesy, cheap and quite bad acting in my opinion.</p><hr><p><b>mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Well as much as love SMG on the tv version. The movie really sucked no pun intended. Poorly written poorly acted. Though I love Pee Wee I thought he was excellent. Luck perry I'm sorry but he really can't act. And Merric please. Giles has it all over him.</p><hr><p><b>Adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I think the movie was ok but not as great and such a hit as the series, which has made Sarah's career. I really think Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joss Whedon should consider actually making a remake movie or a different one at least because with Sarah in it would be fantastic. There might be hope though cause I read in an interview that either in the very distant future (Probably when Sarah's career comes to an end) they will make season 8 of buffy or a movie but Joss said it's up to Sarah.</p><hr><p><b>yourwildest dreams</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Joss I love your show, please put it back on the air with season 8. I want another season.</p><hr><p><b>jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Mathew you're an idiot. Joss Whedon wrote the movie ass tard. Yes, I called you an ass tard. Its a neologism I just made up for you personally. You're not allowed to use it because the irony of being an ass tard is that you can't handle the awesome power, of the ass tard. The only reason it wasn't super is because the at the time graphic capabilities weren't awesome and because Donald Sutherland ad libbed a bunch of nonsense. They altered the original script before because it was before Whedon had more projects under his belt. 
If it didn't know that you're clearly not his biggest fan. What does that even mean? Is his biggest fan like his smallest stalker? Ass-tard.</p><hr><p><b>nadja</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I heard that she burned down the gym in the script. Couldn't find it. Explanations? AND, what's that castle in the end, where did that come from?
The script was perfect, just as the series are! </p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Joss Whedon wrote the script for the film but when the producers took over the script and film and made it more corny and took it away from Joss's concept he left and didn't want anything to do with it. He then pitched the series to various tv networks and producers and was luckily picked up by a new network and given a second chance which paid off! Love the idea of the film but bit too corny for my liking. Love the series and spinoffs and was so sad when Buffy ended but the ending really fitted the 7 years of fabulous scripts, acting and producing.</p><hr><p><b>Joe G</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@Adam: Season 8 is already existing through the comic book series (but I guess us - big - fans already know that). I do not think SMG is going to play Buffy in a few years since she will then be too old for the character. What's more: I would not like to see any actress I currently know to play that role anyway! Sarah is very convincing and Joss ... well let's not name people since to me the success of the whole seven years is clearly teamwork. 
Let's face it: imagine anybody - else - to play Giles... anybody - else - to play Xander... anybody - else - to play Willow... I won't bother you people any further but one thing has not been said enough: Buffy the Vampire Slayer - the series is TOP! If I had the chance I'd like to thank the whole crew - including the lighting crew, yes! - for making such a memorable series! My rating? I can't think of anything but the top.</p><hr><p><b>daggy&proud</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I had seen the Buffy movie when it first came out on Video, and then when the tv series came out a few years later I watched that from the very start- although I have to admit that I was unsure of the actual differences between the obvious comedy from the movie and the more serious tv show. But then I saw a doco on the movie where Wheden actually states that the Directors and Producers were the ones who turned his original script into the comedy that it had turned into. So I am glad to see that the original script was very much in the same way of the tv series. Although I admit that I probably wouldn't have really gotten into the Buffy verse if the movie hadn't been a comedy as that had been the only type of movie that I would hire from the video store at that time.</p><hr><p><b>Cherie</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>All of you that are complaining about this film version, calling yourself big Joss Whedon fans and saying that the series is better really aught to get your facts straight. This film version was written by the man himself. In his words, not mine, the film was ruined by poor direction. I happen to think that this is brilliant, and that any Whedon- or indeed Buffy- fan aught to watch it. There are lots of references to the film in the series. The series is a sort of sequel in a way, so you would be completing your knowledge, watching this. It is an amusing, feel good action film, which kicked off the franchise that we know and love- and indeed Joss Whedon's career. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh, or who wants to expand on their Buffy knowledge.</p><hr><p><b>Robyn H</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in a theater during it's initial run. I was only mildly interested, prior to that, in the art and craft of making films and television. I found the film fairly amusing, but actually thought while walking out of the theater, "If only the writer had more of a sense of hmmm, I don't know, _continuity_. That could have been a great movie." Continuity? I don't talk like that. What was going on? Even though I sat through all of the credits, I missed Joss's name. That film got me much more interested in filmmaking, and I've now become something of an interested amateur on the edge of the Hollywood writers community, and have been fortunate enough to become acquaintances with several writers who have had significant success in film and television. I did notice when Buffy came to television, but my snobbery wouldn't let me watch it until the very end of season 4, when I caught an episode by accident. I saw "Restless" and I was hooked. The writer I had accused of not understanding continuity, turned out to be the maestro of story weaving. So thank you, Joss. The failings of the Buffy movie gave me the impetus to gain the knowledge needed to appreciate the beautiful work you have created since. The crunchy Kuzui candy crap covering allowed me to savor the warm, wild and wonderful Whedon whackiness inside. Joss saved me, a lot.</p><hr></td>
