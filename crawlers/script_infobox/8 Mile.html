EMINEM ROx Ma Sox</p><hr><p><b>jenna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Eminem so much I can't believe he is retiring (cry). I love his last song and I'm watching 8 Mile over and over, me and my cousin Chelsea. Eminem is the bomb! Mwa mwa mwa mwa I love him so much I have everything of him! xoxoxoxoxoxoxo I love you Eminem! From Jenna.</p><hr><p><b>Astral Projection</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>this guy isn't for movies...</p><hr><p><b>drock</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rox. I had originally seen the VH1 version but it's missing like 30 mins of the real movie.</p><hr><p><b>j-dogg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks I met him yesterday.</p><hr><p><b>ja rule</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yeah this is JA RULE, I saw the movie it's original!</p><hr><p><b>BRANDIE</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loves it.</p><hr><p><b>Ray</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best rap hip-hop movie I have seen so far.

I am so upset that he is retiring. I wish he had some type of farewell album or something.</p><hr><p><b>skinnyJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Yea it's ok, I mean it could have been better but you know.</p><hr><p><b>spooky</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Eminem is a poser. He sold out by making this movie. It's only about the money.  If you wanna know where the real rhymes are, come to fish st in boise idaho. Represent what what!</p><hr><p><b>Rich</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome, great movie! The ending was pretty lame though.</p><hr><p><b>mahmod mohammed</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was super cool. I miss this type of movie here in Egypt, but it was really fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>kormeera</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought 8 Mile was the best movie ever! I'm an enormous fan of Eminem he's my idol *Smiles*. I'll always love him no matter what, he's also a fab actor!</p><hr><p><b>candy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was the best. The best parts are the rap battles at the end. Not to mention the fact that Eminem is so sexy and a good actor.</p><hr><p><b>R_e_S_p_E_c_T</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yo that's a great movie and I think everybody should watch it.</p><hr><p><b>Ginger</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Are you freaken stupid or nuts? (take your pick). Eminem is a great rapper and actor. This movie rocks more than 24, and I really love 24.</p><hr><p><b>BRAD</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie 8 mile is awesome. I think Eminem did a great job and he is my hero. He should make more movies, I would buy them and I bought 8 mile. One to watch and one to keep in the package lol.</p><hr><p><b>Eddy(Z)</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Man this movie is one of my favorites, and em rocks hard (or raps hard). Just to let you know that this film is way better than 50 Cent's. I really hope he doesn't retire because he would be missed, but then again he changed rap culture and became one of the best rappers of all time.</p><hr><p><b>demon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The raps are great.</p><hr><p><b>mido</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The movie is cool.</p><hr><p><b>james</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Is there ever going to be a movie on Eminem properly? Like 50 cent's new movie.</p><hr><p><b>Josh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Stupid he did have a farewell album, it's called Curtain Call.</p><hr><p><b>jon</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>He sold out.</p><hr><p><b>Ashley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was awesome! Great movie! It sucks he left but I think he's making a return with 'Smack That'.</p><hr><p><b>hayly tavenner</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love eminem more than all of you!</p><hr><p><b>hayly tavenner</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Eminem is the love of my life.</p><hr><p><b>Willy The Kid</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This work really really really inspired me. Go watch it asap. I bet it'll knock your socks off! Holla Marshal.</p><hr><p><b>Rabbit</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie kix ass! Make another like it.</p><hr><p><b>Steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yo this is the shit. Everyone who hated it can't appreciate some real talent and are all bitches. Screw all who voted 1 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>penguin master</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best film in the world. Everyone who voted 1 GO TO HELL.</p><hr><p><b>CONOR</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This kid inspired me. I'm a white boy but I still rap!</p><hr><p><b>EMINEM MAN</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film rocked, that guy who said that eminem is not the one for it is stupid, the film is about eminem, who are they going to put on it robie wiliams.</p><hr><p><b>OK</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Bad acting, conventional plot line. Typical rags-to-riches, revenge of the nerds type script. I found the rap towards the end slightly entertaining, although it wasn't worth sitting through the whole film for. Well-done to Eminem for making it in an industry where so many others fall, but honestly did he have to make a movie about it? How many other rappers have faced similar struggles without the Hollywood hype? Talented man, exaggerated film.</p><hr><p><b>Stan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>TO JON: you said you would give Eminem a 1 out of 10 Are you a racist? This guy is easily the best white rapper in the world. Go back to your cave and eat some raw deer meat. Loser. Weirdo. Sick bitch.</p><hr></td>
