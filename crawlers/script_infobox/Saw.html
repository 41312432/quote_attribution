This movie series is the best in a while!</p><hr><p><b>liz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I haven't seen Saw but I just read the script. Reading it scared the shit out of me, I could just imagine it. I can't wait to hire it.</p><hr><p><b>lover of gore</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Saw is an intense thriller, people who see it want to see it again. People who have never seen it want to see it asap. My favorite part in Saw is when Lawrence cuts off his foot with the saw. My favorite part in Saw 2 was the beginning when that helmet closes and the spikes go through his skin.</p><hr><p><b>laura</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing script! Leigh Whannell and James Wan have done a fantastic job. Great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Jason13th</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A true horror.</p><hr><p><b>out2getu</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The awesomest movie I've ever seen, including both one and two! They are just so good because not only do you get a fantastic and really *on the edge of your seat* storyline, you also get lots of twist, gore and a bit of humor. Hope you love it like I did!</p><hr><p><b>kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Holy shit I love Saw and Saw 2. I know a song that is exactly like the script just muddled around, it's called Black Heart. I can't wait till Saw 3 comes out!</p><hr><p><b>jessica</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie it's the best lol.</p><hr><p><b>Kylla</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Woah, woah, woah, calm down people. Okay, here is the problem you are having. You're stupid. Both of these films were mediocre at best. As thrillers, very good, but compared to amazing movies such as Pulp Fiction and even Hostel this movie is not close.</p><hr><p><b>Brazilian 20</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw, Saw2 and then Saw3 will always be the best horror movies that everyone has ever seen. I also love 'The ring', it's fantastic. I would like to be a horror movie actor, is there anyone available to contract me? lol thanks in advance!</p><hr><p><b>Saumil Aher</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Just saying it as a best Suspense-Thriller won't be it. Saw sequels are undoubtedly the best screenplay transformed onto a silver screen. I really appreciate Suspense-Thrillers; I make sure I don't miss any of it. But this one really got beyond my par imagination of climax, conventionally not as seen it's really a masterpiece and an example to be set for other writers & directors. Thanks James & Leigh for exceptional story.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I watch loads of horror movies but this is the first that has scared me whitless.  Doesn't this movie just say a lot about James and Leigh - their first movie and it is this powerful. A great script Leigh Whannell, I love you!</p><hr><p><b>Madison</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That was awesome, I love that movie so much! Blood, gore, horror, Leigh Whennell! Yep, Saw and Saw 2 are brilliant movies. I give props to the writers, it's so twisted. There's a Saw 3?</p><hr><p><b>Yeah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw Saw! What a movie! Great story, awesome storyline. The screenwriter and director are now my two heroes!</p><hr><p><b>Jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was alright. I'm pretty big into thrillers and horror type movies. I just finished Saw 1 and I'm mildly pleased. The only thing that bugged me was that I could predict what was going to happen time again in every scene. All in all it was a decent movie that could use some more random twists.</p><hr><p><b>Siris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well Kyla is very crazy and she does not know a good movie when she sees it. She needs to calm down and accept that this was a brilliant movie! I totally love it.</p><hr><p><b>Siria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was totally awesome. You HAVE to see it! So is Saw 2 and don't forget about Saw 3 in theatres October 27, 2006. Save the date!</p><hr><p><b>Carl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is an awesome movie. I saw it almost 7 times and every time I learn something different, that's very good. I want to be a scriptwriter and Saw helped me to see another side of a horror movie, twist and twist again. I have begun writing Saw 4. Yeah, Saw 4. I hope that Saw3 will not take my idea. That"s a very good story, it's a story about... Ha! Confidential lol.</p><hr><p><b>Leigh Lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw's the BEST freaking movie out there. I saw it when it first came out and I was taken away by it. Especially by Leigh Whannell (Adam) he made it all worth watching just seein his hot self! *WISTLES*. I've literally seen it over 110 times. I can't wait for Saw 3 to come out on October 27, 2006. And the Saw Short was the most AMAZING lil movie ever. Especially with the fact that Leigh Whannell was the star. I'd give him my WHOLE heart!</p><hr><p><b>Aditya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw is an AWESOME thriller. One of the best thriller movies I have seen in a long time.</p><hr><p><b>Aadip</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Saw is wildly entertaining, quirky, unique, well-acted, carefully-written, and in the end, it works. It hits you on a visceral level, which is what horror is supposed to do. Sometimes the movie is predictable (as others have said), but the pay-offs are there. So many movies leave loose ends, but Saw just sends you right into Saw II, and Saw III (in production).
.</p><hr><p><b>Damian</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie series ever made and ever to be made. I love SAW. Long live jigsaw!</p><hr><p><b>Zac</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Personally, I didn't like it. I thought it was too predictable and that the acting (especially Cary Elwes') sucked. But as a whole, I've killed a few hours in worse ways. And I did enjoy Saw 2 better. If 3 improved over 2 at all I'll see it as well. Didn't want to go on a Saw-bashing rampage, I hope it doesn't seem like I did, just throwing in my two cents.</p><hr><p><b>Mymorbidmind666</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>The movies were so terrible. They weren't that scary, the acting was horrible and the story was predictable. In Saw II the same thing occurred, just the story wasn't as predictable. I don't agree with the comment that people who have seen it will want to see it again. I think it was a waste of time and I don't plan on seeing the third one.</p><hr><p><b>adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought Saw 1 and 2 are awesome movies. I totally don't agree with mymorbidmind666 and cannot wait for the third.</p><hr><p><b>becka</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Saw three came out today and I went to see it. It was great, nothing so extravagant but it was worth it.</p><hr><p><b>marcus</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Saw 3 is wicked, it's so much more gory than 1 or 2 but the storyline ain't as good.</p><hr><p><b>Kenzie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am a HUGE fan of the saw series! I really want jigsaw to be in saw 4. I love him so much, I will be so sad if he is not. Besides how can you make a movie without jigsaw. The ALLTIME BEST!</p><hr><p><b>brandie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought all three movies were awesome! Great acting and Excellent storyline. I love the twists at the end and the creepy voice the doll makes on the tape. Although the third Saw I didn't like as much but it was still great. It looks like there may be a possible 4th one, I'm hoping so. Keep up the great work Leigh and James!</p><hr><p><b>The jigsaw</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>This movie was ok but Saw 2 is much, much better. I hope the Saw 2 script will be put on this website. I am writing Saw 4, but won't be as good as the real thing. Diana and Alison Gordon will return and so will Dr Laurence Gordon. I am a fan of Saw.</p><hr><p><b>Queen Corvette</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The best scene in SAW was when Jigsaw (who is thought to be an unidentified dead body in the middle of the room) rises slowly. It felt like punishment and I think it was an amazing idea for an ending. I was the last to leave the theatre because I was so stunned I couldn't get up! And I also loved saw II and III but the first part is always more original.</p><hr><p><b>Thomas Walters</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw is amazing, I'm so happy they made three and the amount of blood is great.</p><hr><p><b>Kayla</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw is my favorite movie! It is the smartest thriller I've ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>Gracie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I have seen. Usually when a sequel comes out it is crap. After I watched the first saw I thought wow how could this ever get better, and then saw 2 came and it got so much better. I went and watched saw 3 when it first came out, there's nothing better. The creativity and the imagination put into this. The talent and brains that got used to create this masterpiece is from a mega talented person that created what I think are the best movies ever.</p><hr><p><b>lcll1</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw was a good movie.</p><hr><p><b>German</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Comparing SAW or even its sequels to HOSTEL is something stupid. I mean SAW at least has a history. An argument, HOSTEL is just a bunch of naked women and men having sex and after that they kill each other. Please HOSTEL...</p><hr><p><b>Siddy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely 10. Best ending so far- left me completely shocked. Still love the whole series, and as Kenzie I also hope that Jigsaw will be in the 4th. Otherwise, why bother?  And yes - I would love to read the script for 2&3.</p><hr><p><b>britt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best horror movie I have saw!</p><hr><p><b>OK</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The acting was a bit stink in parts, but I liked the overall concept of the film. The ending was runined for me as someone gave it away! But nonetheless, I thought it was a good twist to the film. Cool movie.</p><hr><p><b>Snarf</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is without a doubt one of the greatest movies I've seen in my life. The plot is just brilliant, Saw 2 and 3 were both a bit less, but still awesome movies. Looking forward to Saw 4.</p><hr><p><b>Drew</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Considering the movie was shot on a budget of 1 million dollars, it really looks and sounds quite good; the plot and writing is also quite good. I drop it two points because of the numerous plot holes. Most of them are fixed by revisionist history on the part of Saws II and III, but it's obvious that that's the writer/directors trying to retroactively cover them up rather than them being intended that way.

(A few: Dr. Gordon could have easily gotten the phone at the end without needing to do what he does; the surveillance system Zep has at his disposal is dubious at best considering that he, presumably, just brought it with him; a chinsy microphone in a camera hidden behind two layers of glass probably could not pick up the sound of the tape recorder from the opposite end of the bathroom so Zep would have no way of knowing what Jigsaw's rules were; I seriously doubt that a skinny hobbling weakling in the advanced stages of some sort of poison could ever get the better of a solidly-built, six-foot-tall, trained police detective.)

To answer the question of "Is Dr. Gordon dead?" let's look at the facts. First: despite that pathetic attempt at a tourniquet, he is still bleeding profusely, and can barely walk. Second point: as we see from Saw II, the house is somewhat large and hard to find the exit to, and it's on the end of a row of several of them. Third point: if Dr. Gordon took the phone with him, it would be easy for Allie to call the phone and have the police trace his location; even if he didn't, they could still call the phone and Adam would be able to. Fourth point: if Dr. Gordon manages to get himself to a hospital and live, or if the police traced the phone as above, he would be able to tell the police  where Adam was. Even if the police had found his dead body dropped from blood loss, they would have found Adam soon after by searching the adjacent empty buildings as standard procedure. Fifth point: Adam knows what Jigsaw looks like, and so if he was found, he would be able to ID him. Sixth point: as of Saw II, this didn't happen, no mention is ever made of Dr. Gordon by the police as one of the victims, and Adam presumably had no hope of rescue by the time he died. Seventh point: Jigsaw knew that Dr. Gordon was loose, and technically by not killing Adam by 6 he did not succeed, and Jigsaw is not the type of person to leave loose ends.

Based on all of  that, I would say that Dr. Gordon is meat; I Would even go so far to say that Adam's continued imprisonment in the bathroom proves Gordon's death. As to the cause, I'd presume that Jigsaw has no particular interest in duking it out with anyone in his state, and simply watched Gordon to make sure that he didn't get near the exit to the house, then disposed of the body.</p><hr><p><b>darkeye</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Saw was a pretty good movie, but Saw II was much better. Saw III wasn't better than Saw II. This is the type of horror films I love.</p><hr><p><b>Jigsaw</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Here is my Saw 4 script. Please comment and I will make more. 

SAW 4

FADE IN:

INT. ROOM- NIGHT

(Inside a room, a woman called Ellen is chained to the wall. She struggles against the chains .)

ELLEN: help me someone !

(A telly next to her turns on, it has the puppet on the screen .)

JIGSAW: hello Ellen, you used to always cut yourself, self harm. Well, in one minute, these two saws above your head will drop and slit your throat. Try to slip your wrists through the chains. Let the game begin. 

(The telly turns of and a timer appears on it. It reads 60 seconds and then counts down. She begins to struggle franticly. But the timer is going down really fast. It reaches 0 and the saws begin to fall onto Ellen's head)

ELLEN: NOOOOOOOO !

Title card- SAW FOUR


Please comment on this script, and if I get good ones, I will write more.</p><hr><p><b>The Engineer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A great scary read, and a very scary movie. I dislike what negative thoughts that were made, because it's a story pure and simple. No one should psychoanalyze it.</p><hr><p><b>Elliott</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow, Drew. Anyway, Saw I is an amazing film with a great story to it. I really liked the Saw series and I hope they make more.</p><hr><p><b>jess</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love all the saw movies. I disagree, I think the first two movies were really hard to predict, the 3rd one I think you could predict what was going to happen more. I can't wait until the 4th comes out and I hope Amanda comes back.</p><hr><p><b>Aaron</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The Saw series is my favorite movie franchise. Each twist at the end is great, and amazing. It is a very clever movie, and it's no surprise this is the most successful horror franchise ever! My rating for each movie: Saw: 8 (the acting kind of lowers the rating. But yes I understand they had no rehearsal time, or much time to shoot the movie, but that's not going to sway me) Saw II: 8 (This movie would have been better if the story inside the house was more interesting and exciting. That's where it kind of fails. Sure the needle pit is good, with a few more bright spots in the house, but mostly it falls short) Saw III: 9 (This is my favorite of the films, because the story is good, the Amanda/her test twist breaks the rules. There are several twists, gruesome traps, every second of the film is interesting and keeps you on edge, the acting was the best of the three movies, and it leaves unanswered questions that your dying to find out the answers to. Great movie!) Saw IV:? (I'll judge it on the 26th).</p><hr><p><b>Bromeo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wait a minute. Whoever believes that Hostel is a better movie the Saw is a dumb ass. Hostel doesn't even compare to Saw because Hostel sucks major Pig testicles. Saw is one of my all time favorite movies. Numbers 2 and 3 are just as good. I can't wait for Saw 4 to come out on DVD so that I may enjoy that to the fullest extreme.</p><hr><p><b>Hil</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant, well written, very gory but thoughtfully rather than just random. I love the way the movie slowly unfolds, the moments of suspense scare me a little too much but they are ideal for the regular horror watcher. I also like the way you can relate to the killer, whilst equally despising him. It did have a few downfalls, seemed to take up too much time trying to figure out who saw was, but that did add to the amazing twist at the end (BRILLIANT)! Saw 2 was equally as good, but for different reasons in a way, I'd give it a 9. Saw 3 was bad, I really expected more from that movie given what it was a sequel to, real disappointment, I'd probably give it a 6. Haven't yet seen saw 4 but really looking forward to it.</p><hr><p><b>Doug</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It's a real horror film! It would have been good if the police had caught Jigsaw because I know it's just a movie, but some of those traps are just evil! Jigsaw should be locked up and never let out. All in all good movie though.  I think Dr. Gordon may have survived because he and he alone knew how quickly he had to get help (being a medical doctor) He may not have returned in any of the movies, but I think he lived and now has an artificial right foot, is now more caring toward his family and they moved away.</p><hr><p><b>saw</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well, everyones now waiting for spiral: from the book of saw to come out. I like this saw bc the story is simple and all comes together at the end. No loose strings and everythings done. I've seen saw, saw II, saw V, and jigsaw, but I've read the story for all of them. I think it gets too complicated with a ton of characters, but of course I'm still going to watch spiral. Anyways, this movie is awesome and so is the short film.</p><hr></td>
