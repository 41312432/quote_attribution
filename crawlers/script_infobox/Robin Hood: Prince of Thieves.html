Costner might at least have attempted an English accent, for God's sake!

And how is it that he and Morgan 'the organ' Freeman crossed the White Cliffs of Dover and arrived in Northumberland. I know England's a comparatively small country but it takes more than five seconds to get from one end t'other. 

Steaming dung to be forever compounded by that bloody Brian Adams song. </p><hr><p><b>Gemma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my favourite films. Yes, Costner has an american accent, but I still think it's great. It's really romantic to see Robin fighting for Marian, and when he says 'I'd die for you' I cry every time. Plus, the Bryan Adams song is my favourite song of all time. Each to their own, don't hate me!</p><hr><p><b>amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I do recognize that this movie is the complete cheese. Christian Slater and Bryan Adams that means you, but it's rad nevertheless, if only for the one liners and intense combat that ensues throughout the film. Also, Alan Rickman is the ultimate. Never forget. I've been watching this movie since I was 9 and it's still on my top ten.</p><hr><p><b>Evie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think it's a really cool movie. And Christian Slater is a really good actor. Of course the others were very good too!</p><hr><p><b>lukus22</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>As I read the book before I saw the film I'd already fallen in love with the ideas of the gallant selfless heroes and the sassy heroine, and the film lived up! Not often that this happens (with the exception of the green mile), Costner was tense enough, Christian Slater played the (I learned my lesson) character well and Morgan Freeman his typical "wise man" role was brilliant. Last but far from least Alan Rickman was hilarious and slimey all at once. To pick a fault Sean Connery as the greatest english king ever (and still very scottish), well I laughed my ass off.</p><hr><p><b>Marsha</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie since I could remember when it first came out around the early 90's. Christian Slater was so cool and also Alan Rickmen was pretty good (he always plays the "bad-guy" parts so well). Both of them are a few of my many favorite actors. Plus my FAVORITE part in the whole movie was when: "Knowing that. Our father loved you me then me" Will said. "Our father?".  "We are brothers, Robin of Locksley. I am the son of the woman who replaced your mother for a time! It was your anger that drove them away!". "It's a LIE!" Robin yelled, grabbing Will by his shirt. "IT'S NOT A LIE! You ruined my LIFE! I have more reasons to hate more than anyone. But I dare to believe in you. All I have to say, brother, are you willing to finish off what you started?". "I have brother." Robin hugged Will. "I have a brother! We go together, side my side. To the end!".</p><hr><p><b>Milo</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Dover- Northumberland- Nottingham. Huh? They must have taken the scenic route.</p><hr><p><b>Jim</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>If you think that Richard "the lionheart" was the greatest "English" king ever, then you haven't read much history. He abandoned his kingdom for years to pursue riches and fame elsewhere. He was also hardly "noble", being responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of women and children who were hostages at the battle of Aker. And if they had cast it correctly, they wouldn't have cast a Scot, but a Frenchman, as Richard was of French lineage and spoke little or no English. An entertaining flick that could not decide if it was an action movie, a comedy, or an afterschool special on race relations.</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have loved this movie since I'd first seen it eight years ago. In fact when I asked mum to hire it for me, but the copy had been stolen. Lucky she bought it that very same day. I think that Kevin Costner portrayed Robin Hood well. When I first saw it, I never knew he was American, but it didn't even appear in his voice while he was acting. Morgan Freeman plays any of his roles perfectly and he plays Azeem perfectly. Christian Slater, well he suited his role of being an arse. Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott. Both men are excellent actors, Michael suits playing the baddie in any movie he plays (Musketeers is one of my favourite movies and he plays Rochefort so well), while Alan Rickman deserves to play a bad guy, he has a way of acting that makes it all seem real. Overall the plot, characters and beautiful sceneries of England are amazing and it nevers ceases to amaze me at where the Robin Hood legend will be taken next.</p><hr><p><b>Steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the greatest movies ever made. The script is really good, but nobody mentioned how great the soundtrack fits in. I watched it when I was a kid but ended up losing the VHS tape. I was happy when the DVD came out.</p><hr><p><b>Kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It doesn't matter about how characters got from one place to another or how evil King Richard really was, it's fictional. Just enjoy the film :D I love thi film so much I can not believe it was made in 1991. My favourite scene has to be when Wulf gets hung. He is so adorable and I was SO glad when Robin shot through the rope, that was a bloody brilliant shot. Also, Alan Rickman has to be the best bad guy ever. He portrays his character so well. I rate this film.</p><hr><p><b>Naima</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have loved this film since I was a kid which is why it's still one of my favourites! I think Daniel Newman who played Wulf did a very good job as his roe. Especially in the scene of his hanging, that really moved me. I love the plot and storyline and I think th soundtrack is brilliant! I love the song so much and I think this film is great.</p><hr><p><b>DDD</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Look, the fact is this is one of the greatest films of all time. Great script, great acting, great action. Call me a romantic, but I loved the love story. Bryan Adams song is quite possibly my favorite song of all time, and yes I am a guy. I may not be a Costner fan, but he was still good in this film(despite the lack of an English accent). In reply to Jim up there, you clearly don't know English history real well, or the time period. Yes, Richard was French, but he was still the English king. In that time period a king was considered good if he defended his borders. Richard had inherited an empire which encompassed much of modern France, an empire he had to defend from Phillip the king of France and his brother John who did try to usurp the throne. By the way the city is Acre, not Aker. As for the accusation that Jim made that Richard killed women and children that's mostly false. Where did you get that from? Was it Ridley Scott's Robin Hood? I like Ridley Scott's movie, but he was trying to make a political point. The truth is most of the muslims executed were prisoners of war, not women and children. Yes, in our time period that's still bad, but back then it was considered par for the course. The great muslim leader Saladin(who I have great respect for), and who was Richards enemy(though they respected each other), had just a few years before, after the battle of Hattin, executed hundreds of captured Crusader warriors. Not only that but Richard had tried to get an agreement from Saladin for the release of the prisoners, and Saladin did agree, but then Saladin broke the agreement. Richard had no other choice but to execute the prisoners. Neither Saladin nor Richard were evil, but simply men of their times. Richard could be kind, was almost always chivalrous, and was brave, unfortunately he inherited an aggressive temper from his father. Jim, are you English? If so, you should study your history better. I'm American, it would be a shame if I knew more of your history than you did.</p><hr><p><b>Lizzie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Firstly, I love this film so much! I do not care if it is cheesy, it is still a brilliant film. And secondly, DDD some of what you say is actually incorrect and Jim has much of his accusations correct. Richard the Lion Heart was of French Lineage and spoke very little English. When he inherited the throne he spent a vast majority of the English money fighting in the Crusades; he did not like being in England, since he preferred to spend time in France or abroad fighting. He was not liked by the vast majority of the English Population because of his constant spending of the British Treasury and his raising of the taxes so he could afford to fight in the Crusades. Richard did not concern himself with the future of England! His own father recognised his blood thirsty nature (after a series of battles in which Richard attempted to overthrow Henry 2nd) and decided that instead Prince John would rule after his death. However, Richard joined forces with King Philip of France and was finally named heir. For a long while Prince John did not want to steal the throne from his brother, in actuality he consented to the renaming of the heir. He only began scheming after a series of events that lead to his hatred of his older brother, all of which were caused by Richard himself. The Robin Hood legend basically reversed the roles of the two brothers. In fact, Richard had a terrible reputation, including reports of various rapes and murders. I do not quite understand why you say that you have great respect for Saladin and then later say that he executed hundreds of captured Crusaders, I would have no respect for somebody who would do that. But, as it turns out Saladin did in fact offer King Richard a peace treaty, which he had no choice but to accept since his forces had abandoned him and returned home. I have a great respect for Saladin for this reason, he spared the life of a man who had invaded his home land. DDD you are not English and you have made that clear, not only by stating that you are American, but also due to your lack of correct grammar for example, 'If so, you should study your history better.' Do you see the obvious mistake in this sentence? So perhaps you should study your history more before attempting to correct a possible native Brit on matters that you are obviously not fully versed with. It would be a shame if you had to be corrected on some of your facts again.</p><hr><p><b>Della</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Just an awful file-- badly done. As a screenwriter, journalist and author, it's hard to believe people can accept this rubbish as great acting-- must have a very limited comparison. These folks love to spout history, but the movie is just an entertainment vehicle-- Lizzie and DDD should get a life! This move is junk.</p><hr></td>
