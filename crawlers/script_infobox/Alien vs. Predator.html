    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Jason Coomooloo</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Thought it was ridiculously rude and stupid!!!</p><hr><p><b>Jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>It doesn't get any worse than lazy filmmakers out for a buck. Good for them for seeing they could cash in without any effort whatsoever. No story, no inspiration. When I become a filmmaker and I'm desperate for cash I'll do something like "Rocky vs Batman". And you know Stallone would be down for it!</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>At least this script was way better than anything that Anderson has come up with. This was more than just "trying to tie Weyland Corp to the aliens".</p><hr><p><b>AVP</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I liked the gore and stuff, I think it was pretty awsome.</p><hr><p><b>marloweman</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry but went to the cinema with high expectations and left completely bemused to the fact that they actually tried to merge two great individual creations into the same film. It was dismal to say the least. The special effects in the film were fantastic as you would expect them to be with some lovely touches to fight scenes, but overall the whole concept has possibly damaged the credibility of the original ALIEN films. It was too hurrid to start with and lacked the elligence and cunningness of the alien. It was almost inferior. In the Alien Quadrilogy you gain a respect for such a being but this is totally dismissed from this film. As the makers said, they aimed for this edition to fall between Aliens and Alien 3. But this cannot be as Weyland dies in AVP but appears at the end of Alien 3 although people have said that it was an android or Synthetic organism, This is proven wrong by the blood on his head from being struck with the bar. RED blood not white.</p><hr><p><b>Taylor James</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Fantastic! Beats the crap out of the garbage Paul Anderson wrote that got made. How could they NOT make the Peter Briggs version?!? It would have made Fox a fortune! That studio is run by the biggest knuckleheads known to humanity.</p><hr><p><b>John</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Is it bad when the writer makes a main character so annoying that you want to die first in the story? I do believe it is. Can't wait for the sequel so I can commit seppuku on the movie theatre floor.</p><hr><p><b>alvin</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Not so good as predator, actually stupid.</p><hr><p><b>Lynx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Taylor, this script by Peter Briggs is FAR, FAR better than the crap that got made into the movie.</p><hr><p><b>mitch</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well I'm only like 15, and I love this movie. My best friend an I have watched it numerous times and don't get sick of it, so I'm hoping that there will be another alien vs predator movie, because they kind of left us viewers thinking too much about that alien at the end. I don't like thinking too much, it hurts my brain!</p><hr><p><b>The Engineer</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The script is a bit jerky. But good, so was the movie. Giving it a seven because I feel bad.</p><hr><p><b>Anthony P.</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I liked this movie. The way they tied those series together was interesting. It's not the first time they put an Alien in a Predator movie, it happened with Predator 2 when Danny Glover was walking thru the Predator ship at the last fight, the camera pans past a wall with skulls from creatures from around the galaxy including that of an alien.</p><hr><p><b>Rebecca</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Thing is, because both the Alien and the Predator movies were such successes.. it left the fans of either or both with high expectations of the joint film. True, in comparison with the original films, I don't think it would stand up as well.. but the thing itself isn't that bad. The special effects were class, added an extra boost of life to the fight scenes. The storyline.. well, ok that isn't very strong. I think they should have put in more about the history and what happened with that ancient colony.. but, then again, that would have taken interest away from the action. The sequel to this, in my opinion, was actually worse. So, this is a fair movie.</p><hr><p><b>Dj Blade Runner</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I do like this script. But I must say I am glad that Paul Anderson was the one that got to show it off on the big screen. Paul is a complete Genius. I have to say If I was the judge I would definitely have a hard time choosing this or Paul Anderson. But I think Mr. Briggs is a wonderful writer too, I just think they made a better judgment by making Paul's version instead.</p><hr><p><b>vik</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>It's so bad that I want to give it a zero. Those who admire it are big knuckleheads, the person here who is awaiting its sequel want to know what happened to the aliens. I ll tell you. He married your mother and you were born. He's your dad now and predator is your uncle. So keep on enjoying the movie with your facehugger friend. Ok for all wise. It's just a crap movie. Wasted precious time of my life.</p><hr><p><b>Vader the White</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>To DJ Blade Runner: Paul Anderson cannot write a good script if his life depended on it. AVP is the worst film in the franchise. It was horrible. I cannot waste my time describing how bad it was. Also, look at his track record and call him a genius again. He wrote and directed Mortal Kombat for goodness sakes! (Both MK and AVP were PG-13 films that should have been R).</p><hr><p><b>Bubba</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Is it me or is this script just a complete rip off of the AVP Novel: Prey by Steve Perry?</p><hr><p><b>Broken Tusk</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Seems at least a few people are commenting and rating that Anderson abortion instead of this script. I read this script before the first AVP came out and was expecting a lot from the flick, I really, really, should not have gotten my hopes up. The movie this script promised me had so much more potential than what we all received. The script I give a solid 8 The actual product I give a 3.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron rice</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie, but I got to say, the sequel really kicks the crap out of this one, and the sequel is what this one should've looked like.</p><hr><p><b>J hack</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I have to say this. Why the heck didn't they make this movie? The first AVP tried to have a plot, the second tried to make up for the lack of gore and blood from the first one. This one should have been the first AVP ever made. I never really read the comics much, but if I'm right, this was an intro to Machiko's character, and I think that's what this franchise needed, aliens and predators in Ripley's time, don't go back and make some ridiculous back plot that just makes the whole thing silly. The only thing, in spite of its obvious flaws, this screenplay was really missing was the ominous presence of Weyland Yutani, maybe knowing about their situation and letting their people die, or even making things worse to get a specimen. It's kind of hokey, but its harsh, fast paced, and the cracked tusk character and noguchis relationship is far better than blades mom and scars was. Shame on you Paul Anderson, you who scarred me at an early age with event horizon, how could you make a pg13 alien or predator movie? And who the heck are the brothers strause? Where was James Cameron when you needed him?</p><hr><p><b>Terence Sharpe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I only discovered this script today because of all the hoohah about Sigourney Weaver and her Complaining. But boy: am I jazzed I did. Solid 10. I liked the first movie but this blows it away. Briggs- you was robbed.</p><hr><p><b>LadyGaiku32</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Just read this and thought the same thing as Bubba- this was a rippoff of the Steve Perry book Prey. Then looked to see the Perry book was written 3 yrs after this script in 1994! So Perry ripped off Brigg's script. (The scene with the holographic swordsman in the script wasn't in the comic and sowas a Brigg's invention, so Perry definitely stole it from Brigg.) Loved this. Make the movie, Fox.</p><hr></td>
