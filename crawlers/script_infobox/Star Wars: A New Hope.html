    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>SemperJedi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Force is strong with Master George :)  Just reading this has put a great big grin on my face; the scenes are very visible in my mind's eye.  I love Star Wars and this is where it began.  Long may it continue to delight fans of all ages.</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Very Good, BUT...I am disappointed that lucas changed the script. Originally the Death Star was not supposed to be destroyed in this episode. Because of that only 9 out of 10</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>
In light of the appalling prequels, this episode should be retitled: 'Star Wars: Back when there was Hope'. 

Admittedly it's a bit long winded and doesn't really sound like a film title at all. 

But there it is.</p><hr><p><b>Musica101</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script is a DRAFT Maverick. That means the writer rewrites the script several times to change the contents at will. George Lucas changed his mind about the Death Star obviously. A brilliant script, written by a brilliant writer. 10 stars all the way!</p><hr><p><b>PenguinShinobi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the most amazing and influencial movies of our time.</p><hr><p><b>StarwarsChick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the beginning of a brilliant saga. I just love this movie so much! Leia is such a good character and this movie is very influential. This series is still capturing people's minds.</p><hr><p><b>Lord Summons</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A good script. But poor ligthsaber effects when Vader battles his former mentor Obi wan. For that only an 8.</p><hr><p><b>Jedi Princess</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Even though I like the prequels your comment was hilarious Limey! I love this movie so much. It's probably my favourite Star Wars because I have a soft spot in my heart for it. I mean, it's the original. I love it because it gave us the amazing Star Wars saga and some of my favourite movie characters of all time, namely girl-power charged princess Leia (I agree with you about her, StarwarsChick), roguish Han Solo, innocent and heroic Luke, wise Obi Wan, asthmatic Darth Vader, adorable R2-D2, prissy C-3PO and loyal dog Chewbacca. I love it because of the amazing John Williams music (I can play the Star Wars theme on the piano, but the Imperial March has such huge chords, that I can't even stretch my fingers that far). And I can't imagine a world without lightsabres. My brother and I turn everything into a lightsabre duel- all you Star Wars fans would feel right at home in my family. My mom's car is called the Millenium Falcon and we make the jump to hyperspace when we go on the highway! My room has a Star Wars Donald Duck poster (that my cousin calls "Polish Star Wars"), we live by the Jedi Code and my brothers room is a Star Wars fan's paradise! As for the script- all the critics who say that George Lucas' can't write dialog need to check into a mental institution! His dialog rocks, in all the movies (with the exception, perhaps of the "It's because I'm so in love with you" in Revenge of the Sith, which made me laugh, so I liked it). I don't think that the way the aliens speak is evidence that he is uncreative- I actually found out that the aliens speak other, rarely used languages (my brother claims that Greedo is speaking Polish at one point, and it sounds Russian or Ukranian to me). Anyways, if you want to hear good dialog, just listen to any conversation between Leia and Han, or R2-D2 and C-3PO's talks. I read your comment, Lord Summons. George Lucas gave a few explanations as to why the fight sucks the way it does. One was that Obi-Wan was not trying to win, just to gain Luke some time and to become one with the Force, and Darth Vader was just toying with Obi Wan. The other two explanations (which both George and I don't like as much, but which are more believable) are that they are both older and more tired, and that the special effects back then weren't good enough to give us another Mustafar. Also, in the special edition DVD, they said that, originally, the Jedi were suppose to fight like Samurais, who held their swords with both hands. Still, this is not my favourite sword fight (to be honest, the Mustafar battle in the prequels is, and I think every sword fight with Yoda is adorable).</p><hr><p><b>Anakin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie so much! It's like the coolest freakin' movie of all time except revenge of the sith and return of the jedi. May the Force be with you Georgie.</p><hr><p><b>bruce</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. As an amateur effects artist myself, I still think it is great. The lightsabers look more dangerous in ANH than ROTS. I love the ben, quote: "hello there".</p><hr><p><b>marty bueller</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best of all 6 films. George Lucas is the best director ever. Awesome special effects and great plot. It has the best acting in a Star Wars movie.</p><hr><p><b>Starwarsfan13</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>How could you possibly give this awesome film a 8 or 9?! Star Wars is an awesome movie and you have to think of the time when you say that the lightsaber effects weren't good. I think that it was good that the Death Star was destroyed because then you can have an ending that doesn't have to have anyone killed and can still be very action packed! Star Wars ROCKS! My mom doesn't know what she is missing because she says that she hates Star Wars and it is boring! I don't understand her. I have a huge Star Wars collection with posters, figures, vehicles, comics, and other stuff.</p><hr><p><b>Erin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the one that started it all. But thanks to episode three, the films didn't go out with the bang we thought they would. This was the one star wars movie that made me smile, because of the wonderful cast, and special effects. Also, I find that the older the star wars movie, the better they are, with the exception of phantom menace, which is just a disgrace. But luke, chewy :D, han, leia, and obi-wan, are like the coolest people ever. They are those people you wanna be like when you are younger, and even to this day, I wish I was leia. I mean, she got han, the oober hottie. By the way, I agree with that bruce guy. The sabers are more dangerous looking than in ROTS. In ROTS, they look like those little glowy-necklaces you get at night-festivals, all flimsy and harmless.</p><hr><p><b>Isaiah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"A New Hope" is the best of the episodes. I first saw Episode IV in 2008, and I thought it was the best movie ever! It had great effects. Without all the clean and unreal effects of modern technology, which unfortunately some of the prequels mess with. However, it was the storyline that has made this script my favorite of all time. I really got into the movie and characters. Just reading the script brings back the memories and all the adventure.</p><hr><p><b>Leia O'Neal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this one was AWESOME! The reason why I started watching star wars was because my name is Leia and I just sort of kept watching it.</p><hr><p><b>Brian Tubbs</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>There is a mistake in the script. It's where Luke tells 3PO the number of the pressure maintenance hatch in the death star. In the movie he says "3263827" on the script it says three-two-six-eight-two-seven. The second three is missing. Once again in the movie 3263827 and on your script 326827. Not a big deal but I just though I would point that out.</p><hr><p><b>matthjew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The great bearded one (aka george lucas) is a genius.</p><hr><p><b>AMIR HOLMES</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The original screenplay "star wars" is the greatest of all time. I loved the movie, the characters, and George Lucas himself. I give it a positive 10 out of 10 because his movie changed the world in the 70s. I would like to meet him one day. But the prequels suck except episode III, which is also the greatest.</p><hr><p><b>elianna coll</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I like the movie a lot but why did padame amidala have to die. I mean couldn't she have gotten a robot body, became a ghost at least! Padame is my favorite character and really would have liked it better if she had lived. I hope someday someone will do my movie that I am currently writing the script for, it is totally based on star wars.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a great film. Enough said. @elianna coll: Episodes 4-6 were made first so Padme had to die in Episode 3 or it wouldn't have made sense. Only those who know the Force can come back as ghosts.</p><hr><p><b>Uttini!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love these movies. They're some of my all time favorites. They have all you could ask for, including a high Jawa content. When you combine George Lucas and John Williams, what do you get? A film that looks great and sounds great. I adore all the movies; each has something different to offer. Is ten as high as I can go?</p><hr><p><b>Trevorliketheproject</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Even in the first few pages, and given the date: 1976, it's incredible to think how Lucas even conjured up this concept long before the spawning of subsequent sci-fi motion pictures or television shows! It really does a lot of credit to him as one of Hollywood's greatest talents, a real innovator of his craft and a pure genius.</p><hr><p><b>Lars </b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Imagine. The difference of lightsaber speed of Obi Wan Kenobi in III and then 4. Episode 3- They are going blazing speed and sadly, in 4, they are swinging their lightsabers very slowly. Very Good Film, but there is still a big hole in the story, I mean, people ask me. You know what, this long enough. Would have been a 10, but sadly, some poor scenes that should have been cut and added maybe to Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.</p><hr><p><b>Vader Jr.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my favorite films, with just the right amount of action, adventure, and not too many special effects. It still amazes me this was made in the late 70s The only thing I wish is that the prequels would be written better (though I admit the third is OK), and I wish Star Wars had more sci-fi elements in it, like the ones in Star-Trek and Isaac Asimov's works. Still, it's a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>ThePrequelsSuckAss</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Judging by the comments in regards to the lightsaber battle in A New Hope, and the comments in regards to the lightsaber battles in the prequels, I'm guessing none of you have seen the Plinkett reviews of the prequels.</p><hr><p><b>menut</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>@Matt, in the episodes I, II and III there are a lot of things that don't make sense, regarding IV, V and VI. And it's a loooong list. There's just THREE Star War movies.</p><hr><p><b>Toucan Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>As amazing as this script is, I can see why executives thought it would be a total flop. I tried to read the script with the same mindset someone from 1976 would have. Nothing like this had ever been made, and science fiction at the time was generally regarded as a genre inhabited by B-movies, with 2001: A Space Odyssey being the only real exception. If this movie had not been made as well as it was, it could have turned out really cheesy, with laughable special effects and horrible looking rubber suits for aliens. The fact it turned out the way it did shows what a genius George Lucas is, or was. It can be argued that he succeeded with the first trilogy despite himself, considering how mediocre the prequels turned out.</p><hr><p><b>Kharlezhao</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Literally my favorite Star Wars movie, ever. This is the one that started it all, and it has been great thus far. I'm glad to see what the future of Star Wars holds. There is one problem though, and I thought I'd mention it. "And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."~ Ben Kenobi. Like, what? Seriously though, this quote.</p><hr><p><b>Aph71</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This isn't the actual script: too many spelling and grammatical mistakes that George Lucas would never make (eg, on the approach to the Death Star: Han "YOUR right", instead of "YOU'RE"). Whoever typed this up-- and using a font to make it appear typed on a typewriter-- needs to learn how to both spell *and* check such mistakes before publishing. Then makes out it's Lucas' original script. I've read the actual original: zero mistakes, and this version is an amalgamation of text from both the movie and deleted scenes.</p><hr></td>
