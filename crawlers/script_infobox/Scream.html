    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>nicole</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this film is one of the best ever. matthew lillard is hillarious in it and it shows off some of his excellent acting skills. although no offence but iv watched this movie 20 goddamn times (lol see what i did!! *cough*) and sum of the script is wrong......!! again no offence lol</p><hr><p><b>Anna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"Scream" was awsome!!! All three of the Screams are the best movies.  Normaly sequels are not that great but after the first they got better and better. Their the all time best movies there is! Dewey and Randy were so awsome!!</p><hr><p><b>cheyenne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I have seen this movie 136 times and it never gets old.I know the words by heart.I even wrote down the script.</p><hr><p><b>cheyenne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The script is written wrong in some ways!</p><hr><p><b>Tilly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was pure genious of its time, at the beginning peak of Dimension films! It's light-hearted and fun to watch, and is scary and in many places. You'll laugh, you'll dream, while you're watching SCREAM! Scream was an excellent movie that is bright and scary, and is not a cheap slasher terminal-thinking movie like there are today.</p><hr><p><b>Karly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love scream. My favorite acctress is Neve Campbell and I think she did a wonderful job. In me perspective, it was a little more funny then scary. But I loved it NE how. 
I have been working on my own horror movie. But, I have a long way to go!
NE way, scream was awesome. I hope one day, I can meet the whole cast. But, I am a 15 year old girl with big dreams!</p><hr><p><b>Ashley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best scary movie ever I loved it.</p><hr><p><b>stefan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever! Love it to bits. Hate people who watch it thinking of "Scary Movie". Well done Wes and Keven, you should be proud! Love Neve, fab actress! x</p><hr><p><b>Jenni</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie. One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Wes you're an awesome director and Kevin you're definitely one of the best writers. I've watched this movie so many times and I was so happy that it turned into a trilogy. Excellent endings to the movies, you gave great hints to who it might be but never let on who it actually was. I wish Randy didn't die though in the second movie, he should've lived until the end. But anyway like Randy said "trilogies are rare in the horror genre but they do exist", thank god for that!</p><hr><p><b>Anthony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. It's by far one of my favourite horror movies. In fact all of my favourite horror movies are Wes Craven masterpieces. And Kevin is a great writer. I do wish however, that the final draft of the script were posted on this site. I can't seem to find it in proper format anywhere.</p><hr><p><b>Sadhu</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>One of the greatest thrillers of all time! An excellent film, with laughs and frights. The writing is so detailed, and the cast is so perfect. This film is actually voted on of the scariest of the thrillers! The directing is grand, and this horror movie blends in with suspense, comedy, and fright! Some horror movies have that rush. But "Scream", has it all!</p><hr><p><b>Tomi</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Reading the script is almost as good as watching the movie. This proves the writer (Williamson) has skill. Well done!</p><hr><p><b>Elysia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever, I loved it. It was so good cause of the twisted ending.</p><hr><p><b>travis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I as well loved this movie. Wes Craven is one of the greatest horror film directors out there and Kevin Williamson is equally good. I like Kevin's The Faculty script a tad bit better. Oh, and just so we all have an understanding, the reason for the script differing from the film is only 'cause it was a rough draft, or undated as imsdb. Com would lke to call it.</p><hr><p><b>brandon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Scream is one of the few horror films I found scary. From start to end it's a scream baby! "my mom and dad are going to be so mad at me!" Too bad the following two brought this classic down from one of the best horror slashers of all time to just another piece of a mainstreem thriller trillogy.</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is always going to be one of my all time favorites. It's suspenseful, it has a horrific catch. I always wondered who the real actor was in the costume, and I have yet to figure it out but Scream is a movie that will live in the record books for as long as I live.</p><hr><p><b>Nathan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I adore this movie. It revitalized horror movies after Jamie Lee Curtis gave up on them. I love Tatum as well, she's such a sweetie. Too bad she died, but it was a good scene. I think the script either added bits on the movies or took away bits, but who gives a damn. Also notice that on the computer Sidney types to 36 Elm Street!</p><hr><p><b>Jamie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Just spent the last hour or so reading, Love the scream film's and reading it as a Film student and screenplay writer myself - I found it a treat. To asnwer a few of the comments before me claiming that the script is wrong in 'many places' - it's not; This is the original draft of the movie, how Kevin Williamson intended it to be. Many things can change from the First few drafts of a script to the final cut which will have been Wes Craven's version. Bits were cut from this and parts from Craven's own creative genius was added. I hope I cleared that up for a few people as it would be a shame for this screenplay to get negative reviews when it is in fact, a perfect version of the original draft. :)

Jamie xxo</p><hr><p><b>David Carter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey. I love this movie. The reason why the script might be a little bit off is because when they film the actual movie, people will change words, abbreviate words, and improvise.

My favourite horror/thriller/comedy -- SCREAM.</p><hr><p><b>Jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Pure genious. Brilliant. A strong balance between comedy-thriller and Horror-mystery. The movie jumped around yanking every emotion. You were either laughing, learning the RULES, guessing the killer or just bitting your nails. Or probably holding your girlfriend as she curls up in your shoulder,. I personally am a screen play writer myself. I am working on a teen-slasher horror-mystery, titled FEAR, among many others. I love to socialize with others who love these kinds of films, all as I do. It is a great way to expand my knowledge on films and they're consumers. My email is reeves. Jacob@ymail. Com Phone number; 503-875-2856 If anyone is interested in discussing scripts and screenplays, feel free to contact me.</p><hr><p><b>evan M</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was great. I loved it, and anyone else who watches it should too! My sister says she doesn't like 'Scary Movie' because they're making fun of a movie that basically makes fun of horror movies. Besides the creepiest line in the entire movie is: CASEY Why do you want to know my name? VOICE Cause I want to know who I'm looking at.</p><hr><p><b>kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love the movie. It put great horror/funny to the film. There was my favorite part cut out when dewey goes in the house alerted with screams to ony to be jamie lee curtis. She is my screaming/favorite scream queen. No wonder they call it scream.</p><hr><p><b>Kevin</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>"I have seen this movie 20 goddamm times." This movie was wicked awesome. The only part that was my favorite and it got cut out was when Dewey went into the house pointing the gun everywhere seeing who is screaming when only it was Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween. That part was to remember. "Surprise Sidney" "We all get a little mad sometimes." "I'll be right back!".</p><hr><p><b>randy meek</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I would have liked the battle between randy and stu but instead we get sid and stu, but it was still the best horror movie I have seen. p.s. dewy dies in this version but craven thought there was too much emotion towards dewy so he kept him alive.</p><hr><p><b>ay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Man this is probably my favorite movie. Only rivals are saw and grave encounters. Its pretty cool to see how the movie changed, like the ending. I think the official ending is better than the one here, and I'm pretty sure I have the kitchen scene at the end memorized. Also randy is my favorite character.</p><hr><p><b>Future script writer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>First of all i must say i watched this movie many times and it is still my favorite horror movie.Because we had two killers.However things in the script and things in the movie are not the same.So many changes,so many things cut out.Very different version unlike i saw the movie.

But it wouldn't be interesting if you don't have changes,changes makes perfection.</p><hr></td>
