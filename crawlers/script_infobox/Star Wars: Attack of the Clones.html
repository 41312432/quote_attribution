    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Kate Silvera</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Hi. I thought StarWars: attack of the clones was brill. The actors made the movie completely wonderful and entertaining to watch, especial hayden christensen, who at a young age, gave a superb performances as Anakin Skywalker. To be honest, I wasn't really interested in Star wars but when I watch attack of the clones, it got the ball rolling and I loved each episode of StarWars. I have just recently watched the revenge of the sith and that was defintly a thumbs up. They are all great. But credits to George Lucas, as if it wasn't for his brilliant and fascinating writing and imagination, none of the movies or stories would have come about. And now, Starwars is a film classic. Natalie Portman, may I just say was also excellent and gave a brill performances,as did all the actors. Hayden and Natalie have good talent and the chemistry between the both of them really pulled it off and made attack of the clones so great. </p><hr><p><b>Hayley Jackson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this film!!! The romance between Padme and Anakin was so lovely and set against the backdrop of a deadly assasin mystery really topped it for me. The chemistry between Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Natalie Portman (Padme) made their love so believable and to watch their feelings for each other slowly growing was magical. I didn't really like the Phantom Menace, but this certainly regained my liking of the trilogy. I have recently watched Revenge of the Sith aswell and believe that these are the two best sci-fi films I have ever seen. Every actor was superb and I could find no flaws with either film. The music also complimented the moods perfectly and made both enjoyable to watch.
Brillliant!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Maverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Better than Epsiode I but I think Lucas could have made more out of it.</p><hr><p><b>Rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Not one of my favorites but it was really good.</p><hr><p><b>Indie Brit</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Better then the Phantom Menace....but not by much!</p><hr><p><b>Daisy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie i have seen,Anakin,Obi-wan,Padme,I love U!</p><hr><p><b>maxcasellasgirl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. Hayden Christesen is HOTT </p><hr><p><b>gen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really like this film because it shows you that evil can love, the chemistry between natalie and hayden was overwhelming it just makes it more real. I think it's excellent.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>The movie was good but the romance was TERRIBLE!</p><hr><p><b>Aly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is such an awesome movie. I loved the romance, the action, and Hayden Christensen is so HOT! (I love you!). Natalie Portman & Hayden Christensen have really good chemistry, it looks so real. I love the plot and I would love to buy the movie; I just haven't. I borrowed the book and the movie; Attack of the Clones is so GREAT! The scenes on Naboo were really good, I really liked the scenery it was gorgeous! Their theme song was perfect.</p><hr><p><b>fefalas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is like the best. The last one is cool too but would be nothing without this.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Great movie! The love scenes were a bit cheesy but that didn't hurt the film much.</p><hr><p><b>bethan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really love the film, it rocked. The first and last were cool as well.</p><hr><p><b>Mr.Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The movie was good for the action sequences, but for anything else it sucked BUTT!</p><hr><p><b>Spencer</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey, it wasn't as mystical as the first 3 to come out. But it made up for that in action. The turning point the Republic made in this movie is great. God, it would have been like Christmas or something. Staring into defeat. All of a sudden, POOF, hey we really did have an army of super-clones. Oh yeah. The script was ok, better than the first. I don't know if they do it here, but in the 3rd. They give the robots voices. What is up with that?!</p><hr><p><b>Patricia</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>The majority of this movie was AWFUL. The script was so cheesy I couldn't stand it. And there were some great actors in this movie, but it just didn't couldn't be pulled off. The action scenes were great but I just didn't like the movie.</p><hr><p><b>mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Attack of the Clones had a SCRIPT? You got to be kidding me! Wow.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It is kind of weird when characters especially guys cry in movies. Are they really crying? Like for example not just in this movie since we didn't actually see Anakin cry but start to, but in Titanic I noticed Jack was near tears watching Rose in the lifeboat.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>So those separatists guys wanted to kill Padme in this movie. Well they got their wish three years later. Whenever it shows the scene where Dooku says:" Patience, Viceroy, Patience she will die" I always think to myself: "yeah in three years, not now, not yet".</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I'll admit it, I LOVE star wars movies. I'm a geek. I think this was the best of the prequels, but that's not a compliment. The only good actors were Ewan Mcgregor and the ever-wonderful Natalie Portman. Hayden Christensen CANNOT ACT. AT ALL. He ruined the movie for me. But otherwise, this movie is ok, but not good. But to tell the truth, I thought the movie looked as if the actors just improvised and said what they thought was cool, but I guess this proves it had a script. Or did it?</p><hr><p><b>dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The script reads a lot better than the film turned out to be. A lot of the pointless tacked-on subplots are missing in this draft, making it into a fairly solid pulp mystery/adventure set against a sci-fi backdrop. All this draft really needed was a quick dialogue re-write to punch it up and de-woodenize it and it could've been the basis for an Empire Strikes Back level SW film... but in the end it was only slightly better than TPM. So the rating is for the script, the movie would gain about a 5 out of 10 from me.</p><hr><p><b>Zach</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Next to Episodes III, V, and VI, this movie was the best. The dialogue was very well-done. I love how it gave a little explanation to how the Imperial stormtroopers came about, and how Palpatine gained enough power to later become Emperor, by orchestrating the Clone Wars and using it to cause the Senate to give him emergency powers. My favorite parts are the love scenes between Anakin and Padme. I love the dialog at those parts. And Sir Christopher Lee as the charismatic Count Dooku is probably one of the greatest Star Wars villains since Darth Vader or Wilhuff Tarkin! And also Hayden Christensen I think was very good at portraying a Jedi who will one day become a Sith; I mean, I could really feel the anger and resentment he has when it comes to his mother's death, and you could feel the power behind his voice.</p><hr><p><b>Liam Rush</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I thought that Attack of the Clones really taught us about the true Anakin, that in the Phantom Menace, you would not believe that young Anakin would become a Sith Lord, the film was judged as a bad film where as I thought it wasn't the best but had some great scenes that just totally changed Cinema, I think it is the 3rd best Star Wars behind Episode III and Episode IV.</p><hr><p><b>Markus 7</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>There is script missing. Why is that? Jango says to Boba we are leaving. Then Obi Wan makes a transmission to Yoda and master Windu and you've left it out.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>As far as the movie goes, it is a good movie. However, I would not suggest using this "script" because it does not follow the movie at all, including dialogue. This is not Attack of the Clones script, as it says it is, so please do not say that it is. My rating, therefor, pertains to this "script".</p><hr><p><b>THE_DOOR_OPENER</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I liked it when I was a kid, so I gave it one extra star. The Geonosis Arena is probably the only scene in the prequels with any tension, and the music is pretty good. Apart from that, the movie ranges from painfully boring to insulting. The most painful scenes would have to be the love speeches, and Yoda flipping and bouncing off the walls. It pains me to admit that the film is bad, but I can't really like it anymore. Every repeat viewing gets more and more boring.</p><hr><p><b>Hol</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>A lot of this script seems to be inaccurate and missing parts entirely. Besides, this is probably tied with TPM as the worst in the series by far. Awful dialogue, ridiculous plot, a film riding purely on its name and special effects and little more.</p><hr><p><b>Kyazu</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>There are significant differences between this and the final version. Dorme survives this one, and Anakin has no meaningful connection to Palpatine here. It makes me wonder if they had a different plan for Anakin's 'fall' in Episode III.</p><hr></td>
