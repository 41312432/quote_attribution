I want to be a newsie too!</p><hr><p><b>King_of_New_York</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ever since this movie, I've done nothing but sing and dance. I love this movie. I went to Santa Fe the other day and didn't stop playing the song Santa Fe the whole way there. By the time we got there my whole family had every word memorized.</p><hr><p><b>Kelly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my all time favorite movie.  I love this movie, I want to be a newsies too! It has such great characters and all that good stuff.  I've played these songs way too much! My whole family is sick of them but I'm not going to stop listening to them.</p><hr><p><b>spotslady</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie of all time. I can't go a day without watching it! I've met 8 of the guys! Jack, Spot, Dave, Kid Blink, Skittery, Mush, Crutchy and Racetrack! They are so awesome and cute! The best song is carryin the banner! I have the real script too. "It's a fine life carryin the banner through it all!".</p><hr><p><b>Charsa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It makes no sense. I've seen the movie and I just read the script. I guess it is true, they always add and delete scenes. The song "King o' New York" is missin'. I love the movie, though. It's awesome! Bill Pullman as ol' man Denton and Christian Bale as the newsie Jack Kelly. "Welcome to New York!".</p><hr><p><b>Hawk</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks. I love watching it over and over. My favorite song has got to be "Santa Fe"!</p><hr><p><b>Dice</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Newsies! This is the best movie of all time. I got the dvd and watch it constantly. I idolize Max Casella (Racetrack), he's so hot. Newsies rocks!</p><hr><p><b>king</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so good. I love it so much that I have the dvd of it. I love the song "I'm the king of New York".</p><hr><p><b>spot</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Spot's so hot and the movie is the best. I watch it then rewind and watch it non-stop. I hope everyone falls in love with it. Spot's mine. My favorite song is The King Of NY.</p><hr><p><b>Sonya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Newsies (who doesn't?). It's an amazing movie once you watch it over and over again. Can't get those damn songs, music and dancing out of your head. The actors are all amazingly talented and fit the characters so very well. My favorite character would have to be David Jacobs - he is so sweet, loyal and smart and David Moscow is a terrific actor.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is mine and my friends favorite movie ever. We love Christian Bale. But I have it on DVD, and my friend has it on VHS which she paid like sixty some dollars for on ebay because she couldn't find it anywhere in Maryland.</p><hr><p><b>Alverick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best I ever saw. I mean the music is just awesome. I'm from Peru, and well I have the movie in english (VHS) that's not a problem for me (as you can see) but my mother can't understand a word. So I was wondering if anyone can send me the script in spanish, so I can edit the video for her :). I hope you can help me. Newsies rules!</p><hr><p><b>racetrack</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Newsies, it gets me inspired to do things! I can watch it over and over again and never get tired.</p><hr><p><b>The Newsie Person</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>While a lot of people get googlely eyed over Spot and Racetrack, I personally think that Jack Kelly is the HOTTEST OF ALL THE HOTTIES! It was amazing how real the acting of the Newsies was. The actors really seemed to "live" the life of a Newsie. I LOVE this movie because it shows the power of friends who trust and love each other. This is the kind of movie that made Disney great. I just wish they would go back to making this kind of family-friendly movie now. This movie teaches us NEVER TO GIVE UP no matter who we may be up against! I love Seize the Day reprise, King of NY, and Once and For All. I want everyone to KEEP ON CARRYING THE BANNER!</p><hr><p><b>Maggie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing! It is a huge family favorite and I have all the dances and songs memorized. The extras on our DVD our great! This movie left me singing and dancing for weeks.</p><hr><p><b>Diana</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I was a young teenager when this movie came out and I am 24 now. This is still my favorite movie and I watch it at least once a month. I know all the words and lyrics by heart and I am such a freak I know some of the dances too! This is a phenomenal movie!</p><hr><p><b>Liz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie and I wish I had it on DVD! I swear the first time I watched it I was only 7, and it's 11 years later. I love it, and I reccomend it to everyone! It's a great move! And Spot. Sooooo freakin' hot!</p><hr><p><b>dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Will it ever be adapted to the stage?</p><hr><p><b>Matthew</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I used to enjoy the movie when I was younger, but once I read the script when I was at a later age I realized that the movie didn't make any sense at all. First off with Jack Kelly's looks and intelligence he could have easily found a better job that would have paid much more, and I am sure he would have taken it considering he didn't care about anyone but himself as he attempted to save up enough money to go to Sante Fe. Furthermore, David was a young Jewish teenager who's parents apparently couldn't afford to send him to school any longer. If David were to have attended school since a very young age he would have literally perceived the Newsies as being poor, ignorant, and depraved nobodies. There is no way he would have been able to tolerate the social environment during the strike, thus he probably would have discontinued his interest in the strike considering he wasn't dependent upon the job. We know he wasn't dependent because his father was proud of the fact that his son was on strike, hence his father wasn't concerned about the money and accordingly David was able to live a relatively wealthy lifestyle. Plus his father would have hated the fact that he was hanging out with such low lives, and that he wasn't doing anything productive with his day besides refraining from selling newspapers. Also, the Newsies appeared to have this tremendous harmony, but realistically they would have been at each others throats on a regular basis considering they were all each others competition.  They all shared the exact same selling district, thus they would have literally hated each other, especially since they were all poor and badly needed the money to pay for food and housing. On that note, none of them would have striked in the first place. They were all too poor to abstain from working for such a long time. They would have all starved. It isn't like Denton payed for all of their meals. Additionally, Davids sister would have never kissed Jack, let alone in public, unless they were married within such an early time period. She would have been considered a slut, especially hooking up with a low class newsie when she lives with a higher scale family.</p><hr><p><b>thia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think the movie is excellent and it's sad that it was undermarketed at the time of its release. To matthew: It's a true story. The strike was real. Learn your history. That being said, there weren't very many lucrative jobs for kids then. Like many third world countries now- or even places like China where girls have to choose between sweatshops or being on the streets, or risk getting beaten for coming home without money. David's father was out of work- you do what you have to do. Notice he didn't like Jack at first, but his mind was open, and didn't stay biased. One could learn a lesson from that.</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much. @Matthew, some of the points you make are valid, but dude, it's a movie, deal with it. And as for the strike comments. There really was a newsboy strike in 1899 againt Hurst and Pulitzer.</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my gosh. I absolutely love this movie. It's my favorite. My mom got it from the library and I watched it 10 times during the next three or four days. It was crazy. Then my mom bought it for me. I love it to pieces. I'm dying to go to New York and see all the places where the movie took place. Especially stand on the Brooklyn Bridge and shout over it like they did. And Jack Kelley is most definitely the HOTTEST guy of all the Newsies and one of my favorite HOTTIE actors of all time.</p><hr><p><b>Spots goil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, my whole family is sick of it. I even have a newsie name and everyone calls me it. Love, Stretch (they call me stretch because I am really tall and only 11).</p><hr><p><b>Anja</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh I love this movie too. It's just amazing, it's really among the greatest movies, and definitely the best Disney feature movie. It's absolutely full of lovely and memorable singing and dancing. Such a great story too, and Jack Kelly is just to die for. One never grows tired of this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Race's Goil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I cannot stop singing the songs, and I'm completely OBSESSED! Love Ya Race? *kisses*.</p><hr><p><b>Newsie Girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Dan Hun just so you know. This came from the stage.</p><hr><p><b>RacesGoil</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is the BEST movie, in fact I am wearing my newsie outfit right now.</p><hr><p><b>Molly </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For those of you who don't know (Matthew) this movie script was based on an actual event that happened in 1899 in New York City. The Newsboy's Strike of 1899 - look it up. So although this event was glorified for the Disney movie it is entirely realistic.</p><hr></td>
