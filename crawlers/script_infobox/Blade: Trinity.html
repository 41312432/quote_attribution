    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Ian</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow, the final script in the movie was great, and this could have worked too. I like that in the origins of the movie that Zoe played a bigger part in the defeating of Drake. Great movie, funny script. </p><hr><p><b>Yaz</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE this movie, go Danica you sexy evil vampyre!!!!</p><hr><p><b>raymond conlon</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>what has david goyer done?
he has ended his trilogy in the worst way possible, giving us a movie where the plot is below standered, the action is boring, the characters are flat, the villain is stupied and introducing what may be the most uninteresting group of vampire hunters in movies, the nightstalkers.
This has ensured the destruction of what may have been a great trilogy.
</p><hr><p><b>Indie Brit</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? Was David Goyer high when he wrote this or did he just not try hard enough? This movie is the pits. Its badly acted. Wesley Snipes might aswell phoned it in. The nightstalkers are well....just....eh....I don't care if they live or die really which isn't all that good because I should care. And Drake?????OH GOOD GRIEF!! IF they truly wanted to make sure there wasn't another Blade Movie - they succeeded if they wanted a good film - they did not!</p><hr><p><b>Bripster</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I thought the second one was pretty crap, but this takes the prize! Parts of it were quite funny, but that aint right at all! and dont even get me started on the stupid, and ridiculous alternative ending... </p><hr><p><b>Film-lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>It sucked. Whistler dies (why do films do that? They say it adds realism, but films aren't real! They should kill people that you don't mind dying and leave the cool people alive, because I get so pissed when that happens, and films should make you feel good). The nightstalkers are boring ass-holes I wanted to see dead, the plot is dull and predictable, and mutant-werewolves at the end? That sucked. It ruined Blade's heroism. Come on, they made vampires a believable disease and suddenly out of the blue comes werewolves? SUCKED! And King? I was scratching at the screen to try and tear his annoying guts out.</p><hr><p><b>Goof</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Triple H was.... awesome. Alright, he's gonna be bigger than The Stone... I mean The Rock. BooYah!</p><hr><p><b>#1 Movie Buff</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The first; best and original, the second; expected, the third; hmmm....what went wrong?! the acting made me almost punch the screen, the story line? ok so it was the Blade vs. 'Dracular' finale...the only thing that kept me watching was Ryan Reynolds, he is the single reason why it is ok to see the film more than once! 

Ps: Whats with the two different endings on the DVD huh? which one is it gonna be David Goyer?
5/10.....for humour only!!!</p><hr><p><b>DSW</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Quit moaning about this and that with this script, I like this one a lot. The flow of the text is beautifully crafted (NOT THE BEST) But it is beautiful nonetheless. It still has that same gritty dark feel to it of which the first two films had. I bet most of you lot slated this film then ran right out and got the DVD. </p><hr><p><b>Nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Some of these people dont know what they are on about the movie was awesome, funny and sweet. You all suck balls if you dont like it!</p><hr><p><b>critic 123</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>David Goyer, great writer. Blade 1 and 2 were stylish, cool, action packed and filled with great dialogue and characters. Blade trinity? Good god almighty, it was like David Goyer got off the toilet seat one day and saw in the bowl the script of this movie! Killing Whistler destroyed any chance of me liking the movie. The nightstalkers showed me how human vampire hunters are a bunch of crap (how can humans fight superstrong, superfast vampires with their bare hands??). Drake, who could somehow speak PERFECT english, really annoyed me. Blade, last and sadly least, showed me how a man with the powers of a vampire and none of their weaknesses can 1) find it hard fighting and escaping a couple of HUMANS and 2) forget that he can tell the difference between vampires and humans from how they move and smell. I give this movie 1 out of 10 because, angrily, I can't give it ZERO!</p><hr><p><b>JaD</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought that the movie was mind blowing. The ending was awesome and so clever! The music was perfect as well but I can't seem to find any of the "trick-pop" that Jessica Beil (who was great) plays on her ipod!</p><hr><p><b>Brandon</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I liked the movie. It was action packed and very cool.</p><hr><p><b>dean</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was alright.</p><hr><p><b>Joshua Pigg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so freaking awesome and I like Abby's weapons, they are so cool.</p><hr><p><b>Viggo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey as an actor you can't always agree with the movies, but this was so cool! I would have loved to play deacon but I'm too old for that character. I loved his lines and they used the F word in like every sentence! That was a little extreme but the movie itself was fantastic!</p><hr><p><b>DeathBringer</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think, if Benicio Del Toro would have directed the movie...</p><hr><p><b>Dark Reign</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I liked this movie, but doesn't top the first two, as most sequels never surpass the original. I like Blade 2 more than Blade 3 but it had more laughs. The effects were cool, although I'm a freak about details and there were a lot of things, script, special effects etc that just weren't right. Buying the 3 dvd set: Blade, Blade 2 and 3 for myself for Christmas. I so want that sword.</p><hr><p><b>John</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Mission: to create another mindless vampire movie script with uninteresting characters whose development is at a static standstill. There is no theme here, and the premise doesnt reach any farther that "Cool action scenes and sunglasses make a cool movie" Not to mention the worst portrayal of Dracula I have ever witnessed.</p><hr><p><b>Bruja</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Oh, lighten up you lot. Grow a sense of humour. This film was tongue-in-cheek! Get a life! It was fun, funny and action-packed! Man, you really need to get out more. Top marks. Loved the whole trilogy.</p><hr><p><b>CGM</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I liked it. It could have been better- Blade could have had a bigger role (although I understand there was tension between Snipes and Goyer on the set). I would have liked to know more about Drake's abilities as well. We know he can resist sunlight, did he lack all the other vampire weakness as well (silver, garlic etc) The once a silver bullet is fired at him he dodges (which is understandable I suppose even if he is resistant to silver any bullet in the head is likely to sting), and from what I remember Blade doesn't manage to pierce him at all with his sword in the fight at the end so we never really find out. La Magra and the reapers seemed more dangerous as we knew their powers and weaknesses. Also thought the thing with Jessica playing the i-pod when hunting kind of silly. If you're hunting creatures that are more powerful than you you're going to want all your senses alert surely? It seemed more about sacrificing reality for coolness. Still a good film though and overall I liked the new characters and I'm glad newbies were given a chance despite the lack of Blade.</p><hr><p><b>DJV1985</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This movie was good but has seemed to have ended the franchise for movie style format. Originally there was meant to be five movies in the series according to an informer website. It would end with Blade becoming a true hero by taking his own life to end the war with the vampires. This was to also see a few cameos from other Marvel Vampires ie from the spiderman comics but with the completion of this movie, the low ratings and the bad critic reviews not to mention the not so high money prospects there will be no fourth movie. That is unless a new writer decides to try for a decent fourth movie, and if Wesley Snipes doesn't want to be in it what about the guy who played blade on tv...BLADE LEGACY anyone.</p><hr><p><b>MrLaZeRbIzKyT</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The comedy relief was ok to say the least, the plot and the general vampire mythology twist was not neccessary. The action although it was cool it wasn't Blade doing most of the action as he usually, and the beginning was great up to the point where he shot the human (i thought he was able to tell who was human and who was a vampire. I think Goyer should have thought alittle bit more before makin this movie and maybe a better selection of actors playin the villains. On the other hand, they Triple H and Ryan Reynolds were pretty funny, but nonetheless they could have done better, maybe there could have been a 4th.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Better than the first two, saw this a few days ago on tnt and it was great, lots of action as always, since it is blade after all, and I loved the last few minutes where every vampire got their asses kicked, and it was also funny at times as well.</p><hr><p><b>taliana</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Well it was both good and bad. Yes some things were completely ignored that shouldn't have been. But it introduced new ideas and an intricate kind of back track.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like all the blade movies but this one is my favorite by far.</p><hr></td>
