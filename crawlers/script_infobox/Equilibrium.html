    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>C</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good</p><hr><p><b>ashlynn</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Hey this movie sucks ass.</p><hr><p><b>Z-MAN</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Script is worse than the movie. Movie is awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Dunneh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Was surprised at how different the original script was. It retains the same basic elements and morals, but is cheapened slightly by cliche. The final script and movie cut is a lot stronger as a whole, thought provoking, touching and poignant. I preferred it, though the romantic in me is drawn to the original script. :D</p><hr><p><b>Christian</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Screw anyone that says anything bad about this film, it's untold.</p><hr><p><b>Andy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Quality film.</p><hr><p><b>amies</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The fighting was a bit too obviously choreographed in places, but the deep emotions felt in the movie brought out some AWESOME acting. And the stylized fighting really was awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Justin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ok first off, Christian Bale is the best actor ever and it is easily shown in this movie. I believe personally that this movie is thought provoking and makes you think "what if". This is easily a top five favorite of mine and although scripts were different than the finished product, I'm happy.</p><hr><p><b>Ralph</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Any fan of the matrix should see this. I did and now I like this far more than the matrix.</p><hr><p><b>Scott</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If this movie was given a bigger budget it would outdo the matrix trilogy. Great script and kick ass idea!</p><hr><p><b>Capt Carrot</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It Is a really good film, but at the same time its just a re-telling of all the main themes from Orwell's 1984- the things that would have been to hard to explain in another film of 1984 were excised, and this (although brilliant) film is what was left. The backstory is class out, and the city is likewise well done out. I think it's a great performance by Bale and Sean Bean, but one of the worst points in the film is the way the main antagonists are so obviously feeling throughout- not that it would be any easy part to play, but when Brandt beats Preston to the floor and starts declaring to all, screaming and shouting that he, He has caught the great cleric, well. But the gun kata is frickin class!</p><hr><p><b>leejohn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of my all-time, most inspirational films. Yes, it does have minor flaws here and there, and the budget obviously wasn't substantial, but for me this makes the experience of watching the film more poignant. More emphasis is placed on acting and engaging with the theme/style of the movie than FX- which is what similar movies like the matrix fell victim to, I felt. 10/10; taking great storytelling back to the old-school without over-hyping.</p><hr><p><b>2-D</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so awesome, I absolutely love it. It's definitely one of my favorites. Christian Bale and Sean Bean rock.</p><hr><p><b>aMUSeme</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>First of all you can't just say a movie "sucks" out of nothing, that's a comment that only people who don't understand cinema (and what it involves) use. Maybe you're just that. Anyway, haven't read the script but have seen (and bought) the movie so: Clearly I'd say it's a mix between "Matrix" and "1984" (the book). It's a very sensible topic to use, so you can point out many "wrong" things in the dramatic construction, like characters feelings all type of emotions (been said already). Yes, fighting sequences are sometimes a bit obvious, but the overall concept it's pretty original and well thought. I have some doubts about Bale being "the best actor ever", I mean come on. He's a good actor yes, but there is no "best" ever in cinema you should know that. The budget. Oh the budget. Let me tell you: big budgets (and all movies need it) are nothing when they're directed by people who simply can't do it. I'm not saying this is the case. The movie budget flaws (again, all movies have it) are not in big scenarios, blowing action sequences, and "super-eye-candy". Maybe just post-production marketing. Not that I don't like it but the dramatic line of such a deep topic is really overrun by action, same with most american movies (and I like most of it). In overall I liked the movie and the script, even without reading it. Seeing so many 10/10 ratings I have to ask myself. Are you at least all movie lovers or is this just a big coincidence?</p><hr><p><b>Anthony P.</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed this film, the action was great and I liked the story a lot too. Living in a world without emotions sucks a bit don't you think? I say, chopping off Tyrese's face was sweet. He sucks!</p><hr><p><b>Ashe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Don't think it's comparable to the Matrix, since the matrix is almost a completely different genre. but I say this movie stomps the shit out of the matrix. Nothing but "widdle bubblegummers" want to hate on this flick can go watch their little CGI kiddie films... they obviously have little to no intelligence and the brilliance this film generates completely surpasses their understanding of anything. Christian Bale is an amazing actor, I have never seen a movie he wasn't great in. A million dollar budget does not make the movie, the love and devotion the cast and director put into it does... if you cant appreciate film, no matter what it is, then please don't be posting comments about how much you don't like em, why bother wasting your time? Get a life, and let us movie buffs enjoy reading and surfing the web for the movies we enjoy the most.</p><hr><p><b>Ezgi Polat</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>What makes an artwork (a novel, a song, a movie etc.) likable is not its perfection. We like it, because they says something to us. Period. Despite some plot holes (like gun swaping) and some mistakes (like some emotions seen on some unexpected faces) Equilibrium is a great story. Draws your attention from the start and makes you wonder what would you do in a world like this. Equilibrium has many great fight scenes. Gun kata is original and so cool. Good casting. Especially Sean Bean and Christian Bale deliver what they are expected. The result is a great movie to watch over and over again. Personally, I like it better than Matrix. But I respect who feels otherwise. In the end, no one can tell you how you must feel about it (or not to feel anything at all).</p><hr><p><b> Me Likey!</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Does anyone know the name of the music piece that Preston (Christian Bale's character) plays on the phonograph in the hidden room with all the artifacts. It comes after the scene where he skims his fingers across the bullet holes in the wall and stops when he discovers a hole through which light shines, then peers in and sees the hidden room.</p><hr><p><b>Alex Kosmidis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Saw this movie on tv one night many years ago and fell in love with it.  Bought the dvd and made all my friends watch it.  This isn't like "The Matrix".  "The Matrix" is like this. Also, check out the wikipedia page on it and it tells you what Beethoven song that is.</p><hr><p><b>JayMo218</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is awesome. 10 out of 10. You are a crazy dumb if you are giving this lower than an 8.</p><hr><p><b>Paul Knight</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love it. The movie is forcing me to read the script.</p><hr><p><b>Barth</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Anthony P., that was Taye Diggs, you unintentional racist, you.</p><hr><p><b>Elikeit</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This was a good script, and a better movie. I wish they had a larger budget for this film. I think with the proper budget, this film could have been a classic for all times. By nature of this film you have to capture lack of emotion, yet movie making is essentially that, capturing of emotional experience. So I loved "Gun-Fu", that was very unique.</p><hr><p><b>mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I actually purchased this film at Walmart in the bargain bin, it was part of an 8 movie action movie set on 2 dvds. I never heard of this movie before then but I gave it watch and I tell you since then I've watched it many times and really like it. I find it thought provoking and have looked up many websites in reference to this movie. Its high on my list of favorites. Another low budget, unlikely favorite of mine starring Christian Bale is the movie The Machinist. Has anyone seen?</p><hr><p><b>Bluesman</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I guess there were some cool action sequences, but this story is dumb. It constantly contradicts itself, and never establishes a depth I can connect with. The twists were cliche and I never bought into the universe I was looking at. As the scenes were trying to show the "feeling" of Christian Bale and that whole premise, I was rolling my eyes saying give me a break. Just my opinion.</p><hr><p><b>Bear</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I have to say that it was a good movie, just the special effects were bad (but knowing that it was made before all the high quality movie special effects, it's still very good).</p><hr></td>
