    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>commodore</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>To Peter Briggs,
This is probably the most rediculous piece of trash ever to be put on paper!  Have you ever even seen a Friday The 13th movie?!?!  Jason interacting with people?!?!? Driving an ambulance?!?! Were you high when you wrote this or are you really that retarded?  Not only should you hang up your typewriter, you should never be allowed to pick up any sort of writing instrument again in your life.  I wouldn't even want to read a check if you wrote one out to me.  Thank god this script never made it.  </p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>
Aside from any inconsistencies that Commodore has highlighted regarding this movie, I'd like to say that none of that even matters - it's just shit, plain and simple!

Words escape me in my criticism of this film so that all I'm left with is this - SHIT!</p><hr><p><b>deadred</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This is the type of garbage that makes people take drugs and have unprotected sex.  When the value of entertainment comes from retards that can barely string two words together without pissing themselves then the viewer resorts to anything to occupy his mind.  How the writer of this has EVER had ANY sort of job scares me way worse than Jason ever could.</p><hr><p><b>Bethany</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>It was pretty cool make another movie with Jason Vorhees</p><hr><p><b>Z</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the best action movie ever</p><hr><p><b>Kaylie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was the best. They should definitely make another movie with Jason Voorhies. Please put this in the movie theaters.</p><hr><p><b>Taki</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>What did I just read! </p><hr><p><b>Jose vasquez</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This is the must repulsive thing I ever read. The person who wrote it was drugged when he did it. If I was the author I would hang myself!</p><hr><p><b>sallie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow this movie is awesome. Just remember Jason Voorhees is number 1. He rocks and doesn't give wimpy kills like Freddy. Unlike Freddy, Jason kills in person.</p><hr><p><b>taylor</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie is alright but it got a little boring after a while. Freddy sucks at fighting.</p><hr><p><b>Raviv5</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>You're all wrong, The Croen. This script's the worst script I've ever read, why do I feel embarrassed I'm not the one who wrote this. Freddy and Jason are equal and they'll kill anyone without a single regret.</p><hr><p><b>Evan</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>It was OK. Jason is cool, but Freddy is just dumb.</p><hr><p><b>Jason13th</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The movie is better than the script. Jason is better than Kruger.</p><hr><p><b>chacha</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I think both the characters were awesome (Freddy included) and what really made this movie was Freddy's humor and gore at the end.</p><hr><p><b>Gorilla</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>What the hell was that? I mean I know Jason would win but him teaming up the dorky teenagers he was supposed to be dismembering! This has to be the worst script I've ever read. PS: I only rated it three because in the end Jason won.</p><hr><p><b>powerslave</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Blah blah, he's high on drugs. He should never be allowed to write again.</p><hr><p><b>Jose</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>There was only one good thing about this movie and it was the deaths as in the amount of gore. Everything else was rather dumb including the ending.</p><hr><p><b>Laney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think the movie was great. They should make a second one. Everybody knows that Jason won at the end, but why stop there. Bring in Michael Myers. But it is true Jason Voorhees is way cooler than Freddy. I gave this a ten because Jason won at the end. Way to Go New Line! Best horror movie yet.</p><hr><p><b>Jamey</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>That was by far the worst thing I have ever read! I really can't believe someone wrote this piece of crap and thought it would make a good movie. This was without a doubt beyond crap.</p><hr><p><b>Hellscribe</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This script WAS terrible, but to the people above: did you even READ the title page? This was NOT written by Peter Briggs: it was written by Lewis Abernathy! The Peter Briggs draft is far, FAR, FAR superior to this piece of trash!</p><hr><p><b>greg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey I thought this movie was great and I think you should make another one by far!</p><hr><p><b>nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I'm with some of you, from what I've seen, heard, or read, this movie is hit. Although I'm with sallie, JASON ROCKS! Freddy's a coward. He kills people in their dream. Oooh, scary. Watch jason X! He goes like the terminator on everyone's ass.</p><hr><p><b>Joe Jonsen</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I agree that this movie could've been a bit better here and there, although it was very enjoyable. Jason X is also very good, but did not get the raw element of both Jason Voorhies and Freddy Krueger, however we all know Jason is better. Good FX, awesome soundtrack. All round great movie.</p><hr><p><b>A.C.E.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jason got whomped in the dream world, and still was getting beat in the real world. Freddy was awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Freddy Vs Jason was excellent. I love all these new Vs movies that are coming out. I can't wait for number 2 because Michael Myers from the Halloween Saga will be in it and for the first time ever the 3 great horror icons of all time meet face to face. I really cannot wait! Also Halloween 9 is coming out in August 2007 I can't wait for that either.</p><hr><p><b>Taylor  Wilmot</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script and movie were both awesome and those people who think they stunk should go shove their heads in a toaster. The movie was the best movie with Jason ever. Jason X is my second favorite. I've seen every movie with Freddy and Jason and Jason is by far the most awesome killer, next to Michael Myers. I can't wait for the next movie it will be so awesome. I've seen Freddy Vs Jason about 500 times and it never gets old!</p><hr><p><b>brianna</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Ok like that movie was supposed to be scary and all that. I own it, I think you should have rated it a comedy. I mean yes it was a great movie but come on it wasn't that scary, you need to make another movie and this time make it scary. I mean wet your pants scary.</p><hr><p><b>Krystal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really loved this movie! It wasn't too bloody or scary, but it was fun! I watch this movie a lot because it never gets old for me! I never thought Freddy was afraid of fire, because most of the kills he did in the NOES movies included fire. Oh well. I'm more of a Freddy Krueger fanatic, so I can't say anything about Jason. I just did not like that at the end, when Freddy was dragged out, he looked at the fire, then at Jason, and started sincerely looking frightened and biting his knuckles. It made me want to hug him. I should not have wanted to hug Freddy Krueger.</p><hr><p><b>Krystal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh. And to those who said Freddy was dumb. NUH-UH!</p><hr><p><b>tony</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I can only think of one word to describe this. LAME. I can see Jason being in a movie as crappy as this, but Freddy? Why would you want to ruin freddy's good name like that? Jason has been lame ever since Jason X was released.</p><hr><p><b>Jon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Freddy sucks! Jason is waaaaay better than dumb old freddy. The movie was awesome. Unlike freddy, he only kills people in their dreams and Jason kills people in person. Why not, bring in michael myers. JASON RULES!</p><hr><p><b>random</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was pretty good. I am a big Jason fan and it was cool to see that Jason sorta-kinda won in the end. What I also liked was that it wasn't a complete crap up like Jason X. I wonder if they're going to make a Freddy Vs Jason 2 and like Freddy's body comes out of the camp lake and searches for his head. That would be so funny!</p><hr><p><b>Renee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This should be freddy vs jason 2.</p><hr><p><b>the REAL jason</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm jason. My movie was awesome! You all wish you were me. I'm big, strong and stupid. Here me roar!</p><hr><p><b>person</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>Actually if you watched Wes Craven's New Nightmare, you'd know that Freddy's victims do not always have to be asleep to be killed.</p><hr><p><b>someone</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>This is utter shit. Boogerman? Freddy picking his nose? Are you kidding me? And that's not even the worst of it.</p><hr><p><b>Atin</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought Freddy vs Jason was amazing. Especially the end when Jason comes back holding Freddy's head which shows for a hell of a sequel.</p><hr><p><b>big red</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Freddy vs Jason was good but IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH MICHAEL MYERS! I mean seriously, we don't want to see a guy with little blades on his finger going against a 7ft monster. It would be more interesting with a monster facing a monster facing a quick guy with claws.</p><hr><p><b>Renee Voorhees</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hey don't be dissing movies with my big brother in it or I'm going to powerkick you into next week!</p><hr><p><b>The Engineer</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>It was crap. It soiled the good name of Freddy and Jason. Know what would make a hell of a good movie? Freddy vs Jason vs Micheal Meyers vs Pinhead vs Terminator vs Alien vs Predator vs Regis Philbin.</p><hr><p><b>Krystal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm not dissing Jason, but Freddy has like, loveable qualities. He's funny, resourceful and sometimes clueless. Jason is large, lumbering and SCARY. He stabs people and cracks their spines.</p><hr><p><b>Tiff</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My mom said it was too gory. I thought it ruled! Nothing about it was bad to me.</p><hr><p><b>D-zizzle</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I have just got one thing to say. They should totally make a movie combining the three most unstoppable movie creatures ever Terminator vs Jason vs Predator.</p><hr><p><b>freakleader</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>The movie was pretty good, then again any movie with jason in his trademark hockey mask is good to me. Though I have to say freddy sucks and if anything he was the movies biggest downfall.</p><hr><p><b>Not telling</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Alright not only that it was terrible, you insulted Freddy and Jason. Jason does NOT Have feelings for anyone except his mother. I don't see Freddy married to someone because he already had a wife! A doll Freddy?! It started to become a Chucky movie at one point! Freddy did not drown Jason! Freddy VS Jason was the only movie they ever met! Jason would not know how to drive an ambulance because he drowned in the 50s or 60s. The heart of the girl's boyfriend?! The heart makes the body work, only the brain has those memories! I have to admit though you are creative making a long script like that, you could make a movie with advice from the professionals.  P.S: I would love to see Freddy VS Jason VS Michael.</p><hr><p><b>Jordan</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Almost everyone has stated it, and they're all right. This script is a piece of shit. But there are a couple of things I did like about it. I liked the chapel scene in the beginning and, I liked the fact that there was a "Freddy Cult". Other than that the film was a bit too farfetched... Even for Freddy. Also, I see alot of people insulting the character of Freddy Krueger. Now, I have seen several Friday The 13th films, and I'm not saying Jason isn't a cool character. But I'd rather see a witty villan with a creative weapon than a 6'3'', waterlogged retard in a hockey mask with a sharpened gardening tool (no offense). </p><hr><p><b>evesparza</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Well, I think is a good movie just to see and laugh for a while. It's pretty funny when Freddy turns into a worm-like thing and gets into the junky guy from his mouth.</p><hr><p><b>Tucci</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't know who the people above are, if they're writing these comments because they are writers, or if people who don't understand the genre and the history of these characters. This movie is a well done piece which anyone with a brain can watch and laugh, jump and enjoy. If you walk into ANY slasher film wanting to think then you're a joke. Movies like this take people who enjoy the characters and give them something to love. Frankly this movie spells out entertainment. And it's BRILLIANT, anyone who understands the series and loves the history as rich as it is of the two franchises respects this movie for being a breakthrough and fans can't wait for the sequel!</p><hr><p><b>John Stockton</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Words cannot describe just how awful this script really is. After reading this, I can't help but wonder if the jackass who wrote it was really a 12 year old botched abortion. Now please excuse me while I go place my eyeballs in a blender for having read this.</p><hr><p><b>Drake</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Well done movie. Not what I would call an original Friday the 13th movie, but the additional character of Freddy did change it after all. A good ending with Freddy's blinking eye but I was rooting for Jason the whole way there. I think a new Jason movie should be an original continuance of Friday the 13th. A gory masterpiece.</p><hr><p><b>Eduardo M.</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Sweet Merciful Jesus Christ on a Pogo Stick to Hell! That's the first thing that crossed my mind when I first heard about this movie, several years ago. I had seen Jason Goes to Hell, and I had noted the Freddy Kruger glove, bursting out of the ground and grabbing the mask and yanking it down under the ground, presumably to hell, and I had always wondered what that was about. Why the random cross-over from one horror movie to another? And then I hear about Freddy Vs Jason, and my brain couldn't process it. It was like an old IBM computer, "CANNOT COMPUTE." Now, I know the idea of one homicidal, unstoppable serial killer may have gotten a bit boring, but that's because of the paradoxical nature of horror movies and their ability to both terrify and desensitize the audience. Then you go and take Freddy Kruger, and Jason Voorhees and stick them together?
Ok, so, sure, it sounds like a fairly good idea, at first. But then I saw the movie, and I wasn't impressed. I read the script, and, not only did it make the movie look like it deserved an Academy Award in comparison to this pile of vile, senseless drivel, it made me want to fly to Hollywood, knock on the writer's door, and coldcock him with a typewriter! But then I realized, that would be a waste of a perfectly good typewriter. This script, was such a waste of paper, and the poor, innocent trees that were massacred to make that paper (those trees were minding their own damn business man and they had to be cut down for this slop?!) that there is no other way to describe it than - PURE UNADULTERATED BULLSHIT! I have read some bad things before but this script takes the cake. No, more then that. It takes the cake, the bride, the groom, and the whole damn church load of wedding guests! So, to the writer of this script, I can only say this: If there is a God, which I doubt cause if God existed he wouldn't have allowed such mindless drivel to have been written down on paper, then he would smite your ass back to the special school you must have learned to write from.
Thank you for your time. Have a nice day. And to whomever wrote this crap-tastic script, go smash your face in a printing press.</p><hr><p><b>Jaylon Pahsetopah</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>What's the fuss? I mean, the fight scenes were ridiculous, and Murdock was a completely useless dick head, but without the fight scenes, the movie was great. It actually make since that Freddy drowned Jason. I'm a life long Jason fan, and for all of you pissed about him interacting, he's not a merciless killer, it actually makes since about him interacting with humans. I actually fell in love with the characters (Jesse, Stormie, Megan and Erwin). Although Erwin's death was kind of useless and he should've lived, they all should've. I also didn't like the ending, I think they should've stuck with the Jason coming out of the lake with Freddy's head, or Freddy and Jason waking up in hell in chains, then realizing Hell raiser was right beside them, and let them fight for eternity, I loved the dialog and hilarious dark Freddy humor. Team Jason. Although, Freddy is still one of my favorite killers c:.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is a really fun time, and yes I was one of the many people rooting for Jason since he's far more badass than Freddy.</p><hr><p><b>3TH</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Stop acting like fanboys with nostalgia boners. This is a movie as shitty as the original friday movie. Only with more badass stuff. Flame sword!.</p><hr></td>
