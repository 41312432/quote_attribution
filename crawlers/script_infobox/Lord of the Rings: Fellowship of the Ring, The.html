Amazing special effects and excellent horse-back riding, me, being a rider myself, looked for flaws and I saw almost none, except for HEELS DOWN!  The music was the best, and I now have the music book for violin.  Aazing actors/actresses.  I loved how they picked out young and new ones (some of them anyway).
Numarie
=)
</p><hr><p><b>XxRacixX</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The Trilogy are my favourite films!! the special effects were brilliant and i thought Gollum was amazing!!! A class film and the music was brill too!!! should be a film to remeber in years to come</p><hr><p><b>elaina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Orlando bloom is so freaking hot.</p><hr><p><b>Miranda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Aragorn is hotter!</p><hr><p><b>Ryan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Lord of the rings trilogy has set a new manner in which movies are being made. This film did certainly raise my expectations for films. The large Cast and Crew of the Lord of the Rings deserve the attention that the film has brought. It is a flawless film. The book was well respected and I think that it has paved the way for future films.</p><hr><p><b>Ulmo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The L.O.T.R. films are my favourite films ever. I absolutely love them all! Fellowship is really good - better than Towers and I adore it. Well done P.J. & co.!</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The LOTR movies are my favourite movies EVER!  I love them so much I could practically marry them! All of the actors did an amazing job. I hope everyone appreciates them as much as I. I really hope they make the "Best Movies" list.  That would make my day because these movies changed my life.</p><hr><p><b>Dennis</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Thank god for Peter Jackson! Finally, a director who is worth his weight in gold. 
Cast was excellent. Best Movie since "Raiders of the Lost Ark".</p><hr><p><b>Joson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Peter Jackson you were unknown to me but ever since I saw the movie I have become a great fan of your work. You have made a movie which is a milestone in the history of movie making. Kudos to you and the whole cast of LOTR.</p><hr><p><b>mandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie! I don't know how to put it any other way.</p><hr><p><b>sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my god that movie is so good, I'm speechless. I memorized all the lines!</p><hr><p><b>xXCelticCanuckXx</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>These movies are amazing! Great cast, great adaption, great directing, great soundtrack... great everything! Loved it, so good. Hobbits are amazing (and everyone else!).</p><hr><p><b>Jason Fauve</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Little could have done more justice to J.R.R. Tolkien's best work than Peter Jackson. The masterful composed music complements the mesmerizing sets beautifully whilst the actors seem as if they were brought to life straight from Tolkien's imagination, perfectly fitting their costumes and well-crafted weaponry. Anyone who has not yet viewed this movie, or its sequels, is a living disgrace.</p><hr><p><b>sumitai</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>If you guys could only see the uncut version, it's AWESOME!</p><hr><p><b>Noreen Mae Estrella</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is a very good movie. I like Legolas very much and his character WOW! It's so very cool.</p><hr><p><b>Amin mila Legolas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie's awesome, I love it! I've watched it so many times that I basically know the script by heart. Go Legolas! He is so hot!</p><hr><p><b>Loubna</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie is very well done. I think it personally rocked.</p><hr><p><b>Obi-wan Kenobi</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I agree with each and every one of you! The sets are awesome (you can't even tell they are sets) the editing is superb and the music was a stroke of genius. I've always said this was the best cast movie of all time. I absolutely LOVE the Black Riders, and Aragorn taking out Lurtz was momentous. The only reason it's not a ten is because of the lack of action. The best are the three wizards: Gandalf, Saruman and Jackson.</p><hr><p><b>Taria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing! My friends always tell me that it's because my cousin is Elijah Wood, but they wouldn't know. Lord of the Rings is my favorite movie. I have entire scenes memorized from seeing it so much. Whenever we don't have a movie rented, I always say "Let's watch Lord of the Rings!". It is so well done.</p><hr><p><b>Snowwhite</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is phenomenal. I cannot honestly find a flaw. This is THE movie to watch. Never have I shed tears just at the sight of hills before. JRR Tolkiens Epic fantasy novel has been brought to LIFE. JRR Tolkien would be proud. The music is great, the shire theme truly fits its image. The scenery is breathtaking and the acting is amazing. This movie is full of emotion, emotion on a level I never knew existed until now. But the most heart-warming, tearjerking thing is the powerful friendship between Sam and Frodo. Never have I seen such a loyal friend, it is truly moving, it brings tears to my eyes every time I vision it. Sam and Frodo define what friendship is, ever since I saw Sam and Frodo's freindship it has stayed in my heart where it will always stay. To know that such a powerful bond could exist is just warming and I hope it will touch the hearts of all whom see it, feel it and hear it. It has been done, JRR Tolkiens epic has been bravely brought to life. What had been deemed "impossible" has been done. This is more than just a film, it is an "art", and the greatest art I have come across. This is a must see for all.</p><hr><p><b>Dan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't believe this is the actual shooting script for the film, but rather a version of the script revised to match the theatrical release. Brilliant film! Possibly the most faithful of all three. One of the best flicks in ages.</p><hr><p><b>Jordan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this screenplay. Go Pete!</p><hr><p><b>Hoosier</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Exquisitely done! A superb film. I wasn't expecting much but Jackson and the cast certainly delivered! For the most part, they even stayed true to the book (save grossly enlarging Arwen's role, for which reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10). Read the Silmarillion.</p><hr><p><b>Chloe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film rocks! It's SO unbelievably good. Now, after watching them, I can't believe that I could be so prejudiced as to think they were just about fighting. Oh and Legolas is the BEST character there is!</p><hr><p><b>Kaye</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>These movies were the best ever. If only Tolkien could see us now. Peter, ya did him proud. Go Aragorn!</p><hr><p><b>camila</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie changed my life. I've never read this kind of book before or seen a movie like this one. The actors, director, extras, production, everything was so perfect. Thanks Tolkien, Thanks Peter Jackson, you made my dreams come true.</p><hr><p><b>sweety</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent movie. Very inspiring! I learned a lot of things from this movie.</p><hr><p><b>haha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Good movie lots of nice, super good actors. Love them.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I definitely underestimated this movie. It was great! Great actors (Viggo Mortenson, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellen). Excellent!</p><hr><p><b>mark</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Who am I to disagree? The best film to come out in a long time. Well done Peter ol' man.</p><hr><p><b>James mitchell</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Lord of the rings is one of the best movies ever made and looking for other movies being made by peter.</p><hr><p><b>nick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ok the freaking girls who like aragorn and legolas should be shot because aragorn was so unreal and fake and orlando bloom is such a freaking pretty boy who wants to find his soul mate in a gay bar!</p><hr><p><b>Dani</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever. Seriously. I love this movie more than anything. It's just breathtaking. I wish I could give it more than ten stars. It deserves it.</p><hr><p><b>Mandie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best movie in the whole wide world! There isn't a better one.</p><hr><p><b>Desirae</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely one of my top three movies (the other two are the Two Towers and Return of the King). I think the acting in this movie is superb and the characters were very accurately portrayed. Particularly Sam, Pippin and Merry (the hobbits) as well as Bormoir (amazingly played by Sean Bean) and Legolas. Legolas' character was very sweet and full of innocence yet has a fierce coolness about him. Absolutely fell in love with this movie. Keep 'em coming boys!</p><hr><p><b>Charlotte</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant! Best film ever made definitely! I also love them because I fancy aragorn and legolas, actually I won't name them all because that would go on for ages but I loved them loads.</p><hr><p><b>Angela</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>That's really an excellent film, I love Aragorn so much!</p><hr><p><b>Alasse</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Lord of the Rings are the BEST movies ever created, by FAR. I am totally in love with these movies. Totally obsessed. Insanely. Like, more insanely obsessed than anyone else has been and ever will be!</p><hr><p><b>Will</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Trilogy is by far the best series of movies I have ever seen. I am a movie fanatic and now a Lord of the Rings Nerd Haha. Well JRR Tolkien is a genius and so are all the producers and actors in the movie. It's funny because now I get compared to Frodo all the time because I have the same hair style as him!</p><hr><p><b>Aji</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the greatest movie (or trilogy) I have ever seen in my life and I certainly believe that no other movie in the years to come can match the style and grandeur of this. I think Peter Jackson is really awesome. He has raised himself from obscurity to being a top-rated director with this movie. Hats off to Andrew Lesnie for his enchanting cinematography and he deserves his Oscar. Kudos to the team of technical wizards at Weta Digital for taking us on a mesmerising journey of fantasy through misty mountains and green fields. The music by Howard Shore is so soothing that I cannot spend a single day without listening to it. The soundtrack is so fantastic, a new genre of orchestra music. The performances by Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin and Elijah Wood stand out. Great, great, great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Kathryn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a great trilogy. It's not just about the awesome special effects and digital mastery. The emotion that these actors can portray is phenomenal. This story is about good and evil, but it also has the touch of love, ambition and courage. JRR Tolkien wrote something that isn't just a book, it's a fantasy that people can imagine and can honestly think it can happen. Personally I think Aragon, Viggo Mortenson, was the kind of character that made this trilogy so good. He sort-of finds himself, he becomes what he is destined to. Sam and Frodo are perfect. Sam is Frodo's backbone. You can't think of Frodo without thinking of Sam. He is what most people want, inside. He is simply good, inside and out. He has no means to hurt anyone. He kind of is the hope, faith and energy of Frodo. He is very loyal, and eventually the reason Frodo even gets in to the Mountain of Doom. Gimli is a very pride driven character. He isn't a bad person, but his pride gets the best of him sometimes. I admire Legolas very much. He is in the background of the main characters, but he a very good archer and swordsman, a great friend and adviser. Gandolf is wise. He isn't a "fake", he didn't tell any ruler that they will win the battle or that it's the only one, he told them that it will be very difficult, and you will have more battles to come. He is the reason all of the fellowship really came to being. If you can recall, he is the one who stood by Frodo first during the secret meeting with Elrond. Mary and Pippin are the "cute" ones of the films. However in the return of the king, they really get to be someone. Mary is the one who really watches over Pippin until he had to go to kingdom of Gondor. Pippin actually comes back with Gandolf and finds Mary hurt, and I think that was a sense of responsibility that Ppippin used. They grew wiser through this journey. We all know this trilogy is a fantasy, but see it not as a dreamy epic, but as movies with real and true meanings with a little dream in it. I'm so glad I finally watched these movies. It has been created with every detail, and you can really tell that hearts and souls went into making this possible.</p><hr><p><b>Kaylen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm completely speechless... WOW. Before I saw this movie I thought LOTR was just about some hobbit creature trying to get a ring to a mountain. No way, it has SO many other stories and things behind the main part. I love how the prologue explains everything and then it shows everything about the lovable hobbits and (my dear) Frodo and his bond with Gandalf. I LOVE Pippin and Merry! Sam is amazing. I can barely pick a favorite or least favorite character! I could watch this movie again and again and still not get bored of it.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was such an amazing film and trilogy. The plot and script were great. The storyline focusing on a group of great friends and warriors made me admire the movie more. All of the characters had something unique to bring to the Fellowship. Gandalf the wise one, Aragorn the warrior and protector, Legolas the keen one, Gimli the tough one, Boromir emotionally weak one trying to live up to his potential, Frodo the brave ringbearer, Sam the friend, Pippin the clumsy, fun one, and Merry the smarter one than Pip. Needlessly to say I don't just like this movie because of Orlando Bloom, although he is HOT and he did a great job portraying Legolas. I like it because it is a movie of friendship and bravery and trying to save the place and the people you care about. This is definitely a trilogy I will never ever get tired of watching.</p><hr><p><b>Harry Potter</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Where in the world was Tom Bombadil and his house? And Farmer maggot was there friend and was supposed to have them over in his house! The movie skipped many parts in the book. But the acting was awesome. I would not have Orlando Bloom in there though.</p><hr></td>
