It's everything that a good movie needs: humor, drama, wondefulr and developed characters (that we can all relate to), and a fantastic storyline! Also, it's a fun movie to quote! Definitely a movie that you need to check out if you haven't already! It's the best!!

I WANNA BE AN AIRBOURN RANGER! (who doesn't?)</p><hr><p><b>jake</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>in the old breakfast club wen Bender gets all thoughs detentions he dont say shorts he says the "S" word!</p><hr><p><b>ashley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is like one of the best movies ever. it is great every line is perfect for the characters, the songs work great, the ending is super and well it rokx. if anyone hasen't seen this movie they should it is one of my all time favorites. o luv this movie! :) </p><hr><p><b>minisundance</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i friggin love the breakfast club to death. it is my ultime fav movie. my best friend n i can site all the lyrics to the movie! we both own the breakfast club soundtrack n we even made our own breakfast club shirts with bender, andrew, claire, brian, and allison on the front and our fav quotes from the movie on the back.   "see ya next saturday"   hehe  :-P</p><hr><p><b>Philms</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Screws just fall out all the time, the world is an imperfect place!</p><hr><p><b>DJ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the breakfast club. It is one of the best moves of all time. I love Bender. He is soooo hot.</p><hr><p><b>alisha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this movie saved my life!!!!   </p><hr><p><b>Lilo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like this movie I'ts really awesome I watch it 1x a day. It's funny when mr. vernon says this: Want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you and the part whaen mr. Vernon says: Im going to be right out side these doors and next time I have to come in here Im cracken skulls and I thought that was hilareous that he said that!</p><hr><p><b>Rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG!... i absolutly LOVE the breakfast club. I watch it all the time, i actually know all the words to it from start to finish!... i annoy my family.. but i just cant help it!... This movie is the best thats ever been made!... thank u sooo much for making it! </p><hr><p><b>Marissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely LOVE "The Breakfast Club" It's so true how people are labeled because of who they hang out with, how they look, their grades, or if they play sports or not. I love how in this movie the characters break those boundaries and find friendship with one another. It just goes to show that sterotyping is wrong and you can't judge a book by its cover. </p><hr><p><b>Coco</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i loveee the bfc . i love bender so much hes so hott! i actually watched the movie like 4 times a day. mann  i wish mr john hughes would tell us what was gona happen the folowing monday.. i loveee claire and bender together they're sooo hott!! aw man.. and i surfed thisother site where it said that judd nelson who played bender , was nearly fired for acting negative towards molly ringwald. is that true?? i mean howCOME they're so good together.. i loveeee bennderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!</p><hr><p><b>emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much, I just watched it last night. Everyone in this is so brilliant, aww especially Bender!</p><hr><p><b>Serena</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely loved this movie! It's definitely my favorite. John Bender was awesome, he's my type of guy. I wish there was a second one.</p><hr><p><b>Amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Loved the movie, but hey why was Claire in the detention? It never actually said what she did wrong.</p><hr><p><b>Morgan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite film. It's so good and funny and also really sad because they never got to be friends, they all hate their friends anyway and they're so cute together. Bender is very hot and he's so funny, I like his fingerless gloves they're cute! He's such a lovely guy but he's never appreciated as a person. It's so annoying that we never know what happened on Monday! Did they say hi in the hallway? Probably not. But Bender has Clare's earring.</p><hr><p><b>Isabel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh totally love this movie, I watched it 5 nights and mornings in a row it's awesome. I know almost all the lines and songs! I got my friends to love this movie too.</p><hr><p><b>grace</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie too, it's really top notch. To answer Amanda's question Clair got detention because she skipped class to go shopping. It took me like 2 years of watching it to get that part.</p><hr><p><b>Kylla</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This is a good movie, but I think you guys are overrating it. I could name about 200 better movies.</p><hr><p><b>Beverly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>GAWD! This movie is great. I adore old movies so much and this I believe is at the top of my list of all time faves.</p><hr><p><b>midnitedancer</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie because I love Molly Ringwald! Plus what's his face (the one she ends up with) is really hot!</p><hr><p><b>maf</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie. Watchable again and again. Great script, great characters, cool scenes, excellent soundtrack. This is why the 1980s is so good for movies! :)</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This is arguably one of the best movies of the 80s. Dialogue is everything in a movie. And this movie undoubtedly has great dialogue. The movie also shows that you don't have to have 20 some odd actors and actresses to make a film likeable. I thought it was a good movie the first time I saw it. But now that I look back on it, it was good, but it's kinda dated. I mean, I'm sure it was good in the 80s but times have changed. It might not come off the same way to the average movie watcher of today. But still you have to give credit where credit's due. John Hughes made a really great movie.</p><hr><p><b>XD</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is by far my FAVORITE movie! It's literally the only movie I can watch more than once.</p><hr><p><b>maria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I only caught the last half hour of the breakfast club movie and had been looking for it on dvd or vid for ages. I went to see my sister in uni and she had it! So I've borrowed it off her and have no intention of giving it back!</p><hr><p><b>maria</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the breakfast club, one of my favorite movies. Watched it more than 2000 times! Awesome movie.</p><hr><p><b>Damon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jud Nelson is my favourite actor in the breakfast club and I think he is hilariously funny. My favourite movie!</p><hr><p><b>Katherine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I found out that the principal, Paul Gleason died. That movie was the best. Judd Nelson is so hot, so is Emilio Estevez.</p><hr><p><b>Hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks!</p><hr><p><b>Allison Cole</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hi my name is Allison, and I was wondering if anyone knows what the song is that bender is "singing" to himself near the beginning. It is like nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. Sorry for being not clear, but he is like playing air guitar. This movie kicks ass, Emilio is my favorite actor. Young Guns is my favorite movie of all time!</p><hr><p><b>Meron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is truly great. The message it sends is amazing, if only they could still make movies like that. I thought this movie was okay until it hit around the end when they're in a circle- the breakfast club circle- and talk about their lives, why they are there and what they've experienced.</p><hr><p><b>stevo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so true, it's just like real life. This movie rocks.</p><hr><p><b>mexican guy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's such a great movie, everything is perfect. Molly Ringwald looks great, I congratulate everyone who participated in the making of this film, it has everything a movie needs, comedy, drama, great dialogues, great music, unforgottable scenes. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?</p><hr><p><b>Rainie Lowe</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I can't get enough of this incredible movie. Anthony Michael Hall is so hot, it was great in sixteen candles too. I was in band class and I did that lil hum they did in the movie, it made me super funny that day. Nerds are hot, I may be weird, but I ain't.</p><hr><p><b>Kaitlyn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love "The Breakfast Club"! I'm in theater class and my group is doing it. Although we had to edit it.</p><hr><p><b>Alex.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My favorite film of all time. Just to answer that question, it does say what Claire got in detention for. She skipped class to go shopping. Her dad says it in the very beginning when he hands her her lunch. Just wanted to clear that up!</p><hr><p><b>tara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Lalalala my other horse is a unicorn!</p><hr><p><b>Geo</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Does anyone no what song Bender is hummin at the start of the movie?</p><hr><p><b>Darren</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Deep Purple- Smoke on the Water? This is like my favourite movie. I wish I had been old enough to see it when it came out. Anyway, I love how this movie brings back my childhood to me in a way, must be Simple Minds excellent "Don't You (forget about me)." Absolutely love that song.</p><hr><p><b>OK</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It was quirky, serious and sweet. I loved it.</p><hr><p><b>Damon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think this is an amazing movie. It has a perfect blend of comedy and drama, anger and happiness, everything a real movie needs. The best thing about this movie is that no matter who you are you can understand in some way what these amazing characters are going through and feeling. Not going to lie it gives me goosebumps every time I read over the script, or watch the movie. This could easily be the greatest movie of all time. BIG KUDOS GO OUT TO JOHN HUGHES! He is a great inspiration to all writers.</p><hr><p><b>Luke</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies EVER. I love this movie and I think it should be a law for EVERYBODY to see it .

The best part is when they all get baked.</p><hr><p><b>Oz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. I thinks it's brilliant and has some of the best actors. The script is amazing and I love how there is not much of a setting, to where it becomes overwhelming, but that just means the actors have to do a better job - which they did times 10.</p><hr><p><b>M-G</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Definitely one of the best movies of that era. One of my favourite bits is when Brain tells them what his name is, and bender goes "my condolences". Hehehe, classic.</p><hr><p><b>Bee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My stepmum showed it to me the other day, and totally knocked 'The Lost Boys' and 'Wayne's World' off the top of my favorite movies list. It's just so perfect! By the way, anyone know where I can get those fingerless gloves from?</p><hr><p><b>AZZA</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the greatest. The story of it is intriguing and inspiring. Complete with a music soundtrack of the 80's and the unfamiliar troubles of 5 completely different teenagers, it receives a perfect 10 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>Arthur</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow, you do get the rabid fans on here. Definitely the best of Hughes' work and in my opinion, the best teen movie I've seen yet.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The song Bender is humming and playing air guitar to is "Sunshine of your Love" by Cream (featuring Eric Clapton). It is NOT Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water. Best movie EVER.</p><hr><p><b>IMJUSTME</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Killa movie. The song john sings at the beginning is the main guitar riff from Cream's "Sunshine of Your Love".</p><hr><p><b>Max Manfre</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There is nothing like the "Brat Pack". All five stars in the "Breakfast Club" were fantastic. They all had good and bad qualities. My favorite character was John Bender. In one way he was mean, but in another way he wasn't. I pretty much understood the John Bender character. </p><hr><p><b>Kandace</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that the whole point of it was to not worry about or think about what was going to happen on Monday, but to just enjoy Saturday. Is enjoy the right word? Bender is my hero. The best of John Hughes, except Ferris Bueller... but that's different. I love them both.</p><hr><p><b>Alexis Tisby</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a very excellent movie has lots of good dialogue and humor. If you have not watched it, I recommend it.</p><hr><p><b>Dean Roa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my favourite movies of my youth. Hughes writing is full of wit, humour, empathy for its subject matter and is totally engrossing. As was his directing, coaching first class performances from his young cast. The 80s without John Hughes would have been like the 50s without James Deans movies. RIP Mr Hughes, remembered forever on film.</p><hr><p><b>J.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very well-written script to what was a beautiful film. I just want to live in a John Hughes teen film.</p><hr></td>
