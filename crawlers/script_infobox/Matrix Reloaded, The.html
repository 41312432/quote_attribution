Everything is nice in this film , and i really love it.</p><hr><p><b>Dibbs</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very difrent to the shooting script for the final movie. There are some great visual senes in the script, but somehow i can't see how the desert would have worked, it just wouldnt have looked right within the look of the matrix, though i'm sure the W Bros would have made it work. It would have been nice to have read the third part of this storie though, as it is so difrent, it would have been nice to see how it ended.
Its nice to see that they do keep some small details from this script in the final version.</p><hr><p><b>Micah</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Wow. Quite a different take on what eventually got made into a film. I really like the transition from the ending of the first film into the second. Some of the characters were good, especially the inclusion of Choi and DuJour from the first film as Zion hackers. Still this version definitely has the feel of an early script. It seems that some themes are pretty undeveloped, though the world of the Matrix is explained at a greater level of detail here than finally came out in the film, IMO.  I don't think this should have been filmed as is, but I do feel that Reloaded would have made more sense if they had used more material from this version of the script.</p><hr><p><b>André Navarro</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A fantastic script that would have made the Matrix trilogy into one of the greatest of all time, but unfortunately it was not used, and the final version of Matrix Reloaded sucked. A big, big shame.</p><hr><p><b>XxRacixX</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think it is a great film but i think they should have stopped after this film and not ruined it with the third film. My favourite scene has to be the highway!!! it is such a cool action scene!!</p><hr><p><b>Mo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This script is far better than the confusing crap they filmed. They fell into the trap Lucas fell into, which is worrying too much about special effects and very little on the script. What made Lord of the Rings great and Titanic was an awesome script. Spend the millions on that, not just on cool effects.</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Ok, for all you trenchcoat loving shades wearing army boy wannabes, here is the film for you. Silly and predictable. I am so sick of wire flipping bullet shell casings flying. Yes the movie is visually neat, but CGI is CGI. I can see it a mile away and it looks fake as crap. Sorry Wachowskis, I'm not falling for this crap. And whatever happened to just two guys fighting? Just punch the guy you sissy! I don't even know what was happening anyway in this movie. Cool flying spiders though.</p><hr><p><b>Me, me, me</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I felt better with the final version used in the film. The script we have here is different but the story is too easy and leaves nearly no place to think about what happens because we have it black on white. The final version was a mind-twisting one and I liked it more.</p><hr><p><b>Ashley</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I prefer the final movie compared to the script. It leaves more to be thought about, engages the audience more and adds the effect that the matrix is unpredictable and not straight-forward.</p><hr><p><b>Joe Brandt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am a major fan of the Matrix trilogy (3rd one - eh could be better). I read this script and although I liked the final version, I am very curious about what this would be like if it were filmed as well. Someday someone could do it, but probably not at all. Interesting theme as they would cut the One's off from the rebels. And the agents being cowards about fighting Neo they would use a predecesscor, neat idea.</p><hr><p><b>IknowKungFu</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Wachowskis wouldnt have had HALF THE CRITICS who blasted away at Reloaded had this had been the script they used! Oh my god! I loved Gregory LowFielder. He's such a great character and he makes more sense (than Smith) as the sequels villain (as the Oracle told Neo about Smith in Revolutions) "He is YOU Neo. He is your OPPOSITE. The result of the equation trying to BALANCE itself out". Not to mention that the Matrix is actually EXPLAINED in some detail! That's why so many people disliked Reloaded! Jesus Christ they had it all along, they just didn't use it! Goddamnit.

I'd recommend this to ALL critics of Reloaded. Its producer Joel Silvers' fault Reloaded & Revolutions were disappointing to most. 

Look forward to the Wachowskis next hit: "Dreamscapeaxis" or simply "The Axis" trilogy! And read "Burlyman Entertainment", the Wachowskis Comic Company.</p><hr><p><b>Naut</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I really enjoyed all of the Matrix films. Like whoa. I believe that people didn't enjoy the second and third movies because they were vastly different than the first one, and people went to see Reloaded and Revolutions expecting to see more of the original. That is their mistake. I thought all three movies were thought-provoking and very entertaining, besides how people may feel about CGI. I thought the films were visually stunning as well as emotionally driven. Reloaded's original script here is interesting, but like a couple of other users have mentioned it paints everything out in black and white for you. Unlike in the actual movie, there's so many more layers. It shows that the Matrix isn't to be taken lightly and there are so many different aspects to it. That notion was only briefly covered in this script. I personally didn't like the idea of Gregory LowFielder. I didn't think it made much sense. I much more enjoyed that Neo's programming was somehow copied onto the Smith program, and he simply decided to exile himself within the Matrix. Made much more sense that Smith coming back, upgraded, and trying to train this Greg guy to beat Neo. It leaves way too much unexplained. And the Smith virus was just so acceptable. The ending of this script left me so disappointed, it was a weak cliffhanger, whereas the filmed ending leaves you breathless. I'm a fan of both this script and of the actual film. I'd love to see what the Brothers had written for Revolutions originally. I'd really like to read that.</p><hr><p><b>Neo</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>This script sucked. If they filmed this stuff the whole trilogy would be in the hole. Bare in mind that it does answer some questions that the real movie left behind. This draft script was only the story of the other 18 or 19 months we don't see in the films. I feel this is only good as a story or script, not as a film. I'm glad they never brought that Gregory guy into the films, it would take away from the urban settings the Matrix is known for. The Metacortex building as the mainframe was kind of predictable for me. The movie was better because it introduced new philosophy and mythology like the first movie, this would just take away from that.</p><hr><p><b>KAI</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I wrote this script. It didn't come from Wachowskis whatsoever. I wrote it at work in about 2 days because I couldn't wait for "Reloaded" to hit theaters. I'm going to write my own version of "Revolutions" based on this script after the book I'm currently writing because I recently ego-searched this script and found many fans.</p><hr><p><b>sudhir singh</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Very good movie. Watch it.</p><hr><p><b>hassan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's really a great film. One of the most interesting ones I had ever seen in my life. I recommend you watch it.</p><hr><p><b>Tim</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Gregory Lowfield seemed like a sci version of Swayze from Point Break. I scrolled down to see if he surfed a wave of Matrix code to his own demise. Alas, no such luck. I would have loved to see it made though. Keanu Reeves doing his own version of a Goliath character (Knight Rider, anyone?) would have been priceless. Mustache and all.</p><hr><p><b>Gell</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I like it. But the first part of the trilogy was the best. Hello from Russia!</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I actually liked this movie. The only significant part for me was the crazy burly brawl battle of the million Agent Smiths versus the one Neo. This one was better than the first and third.</p><hr><p><b>Karl Popper</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>To be honest, if they included Choi and Dujuor in the film and used this script, I would have liked The Matrix Trilogy more.</p><hr><p><b>Cornman</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Strangely, I'd give the movie a 7 as well. I like certain parts of both, but ultimately I'd prefer the original script. Mind you, this script is hardly immaculate, but it has a lot of good things going for it. Things the movie sort of lacked.
There are a lot of things here that should've made it into the final draft. For instance, many people probably noticed the huge shift in tone starting with the 2nd film. At first, it's all about the nature of reality, and before you know it, the films spiral off into completely different thematic territory. Not saying that's a bad thing, but I appreciate that this script seems more consistent with its predecessor.
At its roots, the Matrix was a cult cyberpunk film, and the sequels took it away from its roots. Having the Matrix explained in further detail, having its inner workings play a greater part in the story itself, was an aspect the Wachowski's definitely should've kept in.
I'm all for the philosophical angle, but I wish the Wachowskis had the Matrix grounded in its roots, for God's sake. The first film was all about questioning reality. The fact that this script further expands on a theme ALREADY began really makes this feel like a sequel.
Feel like I'm ranting a lot here. Sorry.
...But the film's cliffhanger was SO weak. I like this one a lot better. All right, I'm done.</p><hr><p><b>Fang</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Guys, the Wachowski Brothers didn't write this. The Matrix Reloaded was never going to be like this version. It's well wrote but there are so many inconsistencies and uncharacteristic traits throughout. Since when is someone getting jacked in called a reload? Neo swearing? It's a fan script. The film version (the actual theatrical official story) is a thousand times better. Still, as a standalone script, meh....</p><hr><p><b>Thomas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>
A film taken in a different aspect.  Although we think it's about some kind of war between the machines and humans, it also pin points to our near future. Each dialouge in the matrix triology have more than one meaning. Some of the are inspiring, some are guiding etc. Most of the  dialouges of Morhpeous, Smith and Oracle are fabolous. They give us a diferent perspective about life, choice, purpose etc. 

I love all the three movies. I am  a bit dissapointed that the Matrix team made the film a triology.</p><hr><p><b>Matrixfan</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I think that was a great movie with an appropriate mix of action, romance and science fiction. I also think the casting for this movie was, with the exception of a few, was excellent. Unlike in most film series, the Matrix Reloaded was a movie that was as good as the first if not even better. I applaud the Wachowski brothers for their work and hope they will continue the series after the trilogy.</p><hr><p><b>Micon75</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Let's face it, Reloaded and Revolutions were fun to watch but other than that they sucked. This original script is smart and that is what I liked about the original movie. I would love to see this script made into a movie and wash our hands of that other garbage. I personally love movies that people just don't get. My suggestion for a 3rd installment would have been to add another layer of reality that Neo could fall out of into a world healed which would tie in tightly with with statements made in the first movie. "as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery" which would explain the utter crappiness of the real world. The Architect says they expect people to break out so if it were a well designed system they would have created another sub reality to catch those who free themselves from the first reality. That would have made Neo's connection with the sentinel make sense also.</p><hr><p><b>John</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I bet this is the Larry draft before Andy did his thing with it. Kind of a 1-2 punch these guys. Common- it sucks all hell beyond ridiculous- pure crap as is. Not even '70's TV. But it reveals a few points, huh? Valuable. Hope to find more like it. I am sure glad they finished it.</p><hr><p><b>Neos Brother</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I'm going to keep it simple. This version sucked.</p><hr><p><b>Elli</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry, I thought this was absolutely horrible. I'm a huge fan of The Matrix Trilogy- I thought all three films were brilliant. I was directed here to read the script and at first I wasn't even sure this was The Matrix! The person who wrote this filled in the six month gap but I liked that the Wachowski's left it out. It left so much more for the imagination. Also, I very much disliked the new characters. I did laugh a bit when Neo was drunk but it just didn't fit in right. Neo and Trinity were never displayed as the get smashed and lose control type. I thought almost everyone was out of character and I didn't like the plot. Also, it didn't even feel like the Wachowski's writing. It just didn't feel right as The Matrix.</p><hr><p><b>Ken</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>My take, if you allow yourself to land in the fiction world you will love this movie big time, for me Morpheus, the oracle and the architect are my best. Basically they seem to set a theme without which this movie would be the worst ever. Romance, emotion, cause and effect are better expressed here than in the earlier version. Haters stop it.</p><hr><p><b>Jared</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Guys, this is NOT the actual script! This is a fan script! See "KAI" 's comment on here. IMSDB should really take this down.</p><hr><p><b>Kris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I much prefer this version to the one they shot. If it actually is fan-written, does anybody know if there is a written sequel out there somewhere? I want to know how this story ends.</p><hr><p><b>Trinity</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Is this real? What is real? How do you define real? If real is what you can taste, see, smell or touch, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. I'm sorry I couldn't resist quoting the matrix.</p><hr></td>
