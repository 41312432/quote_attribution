    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Josh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This Movie is not about laughs you moron it is about the obsticals love has to overcome in a world were no one cares.</p><hr><p><b>IMSDb</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I should clarify that I was not expecting a comedy by any means. Just that the only positives I took from it were a couple of cheap laughs, while the rest was a hardcore yawn. Not my cup of tea I suppose :)</p><hr><p><b>carla</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>"I am Sam" is a movie so full of love that I think can show anyone how to love. There are funny moments where you can definitely relate to them but the moral to the story is so much deeper than this. I cried in the movie and it truly touched my heart. I know how cliched. But it was a lovely movie and I would tell everyone I knew to watch it.</p><hr><p><b>Amy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was great. I loved the action! When Arnold is running down the street, screaming  "MY LEGS ARE ON FIRE!" very intense. And when that retarded guy falls down the stairs. I almost pee'd myself. Anyway, this movie was a nice laugh. I'm very impressed with the fact that Curtis Jackson (50 Cent) directed this movie. Certainly will not be his last. It was a perfect role for Sean Penn. 3 thumbs up.</p><hr><p><b>Jiggle Billy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am Sam was the best movie I have ever seen! I almost defecated on my couch I was laughing so hard! For anyone who thinks this movie is "heart warming" you're dead wrong. It's just a cheap laugh. I bet Sean Penn didn't even have to research this role, I bet it came naturally! And you my friend, Josh you are a pansy! I bet you have rainbow sheets on your bed and a backstreet boy poster on your wall! You are clearly of homosexual descent, you absolutely love men! Never has a person angered me so much! Well all in all I think "I am Sam" is hilarious. I recommend it to anybody who likes to get high and eat cheetos naked on their couch.</p><hr><p><b>Garrett</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie! I just wanted to point out to Amy that this movie was not directed by 50 Cent (are you kidding me?), it was directed by Jessie Nelson. That is all.</p><hr><p><b>oliver</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Top movie, best drama I've ever watched.</p><hr><p><b>Jada</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Very good movie. Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer (did I spell that right?) and Dakota Fanning were great. Probably could've been rated PG, too. Very good.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is fantastic. But seriously what is with people saying this movie is funny? And just because someone said they cried does not mean they are a pansy. Just because someone has emotions does not make them bad, if anything it makes them a better person. So to jiggle billy and others I think its time you got a life! You are sick in the head if you watch this movie and feel no sadness.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I liked this film. Sean Penn studied the way mentally challenged persons acted at L.A. Goal.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was absolutely great, I would give this movie 2 thumbs way up!</p><hr><p><b>Stacie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was not a 3 out of 10, more like a 9 out of 10. This movie was not about two laughs and hardcore yawn! This movie was touching and loving. You morons don't even care how those people suffer because of the idiotic piece of s--- you do and treat mentally challenged people. This proves how much many people out there don't even care how they feel.</p><hr><p><b>niloo</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Sean Penn is wonderful. I love it that is the movie you must see.</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous2</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It is scary how true to life the events in this movie are. It is hard to imagine being mentally handicapped and never realizing that most people are laughing at you and not with you. Perhaps ignorance is bliss when you actually never realize how oppressed society keeps you and then despite them you have love and happiness.</p><hr><p><b>Maggie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is an AMAZING movie! Sean Penn is at his very, very best. Michelle Pfeiffer makes some bold and terrific choices. Dakota Fanning, well what can you say, is fantastic. The courtroom is bathed in blue which give it an all-telling eerie feeling of the ice cold, heartlessness of the situation. A definite MUST see!</p><hr><p><b>I beg to differ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>IMSDb opinion???  WHO/WHAT ARE YOU?? ARE YOU serious?? WHO are you and HOW are you qualified to review movies of this HIGH quality?? Perhaps if you would take a moment and drag yourself away from your Death Race video game and maybe skip one of THE SAW sequels you could be enlightened as to what makes a great movie. A mentally challenged man having his daughter ripped from his life and his heart does not garner a ton of yuks! Get a clue.</p><hr><p><b>Beccy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best films I've seen in a long long time. It has funny moments (like when Annie shouts 'no' in the car and Rita's face is very funny) However the movie is not funny. It is sad, touching and made me want to cry all the way through. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of my favourite actresses so maybe I'm biased but I wasn't clear on Sean Penn's abilities etc but I do believe he played this role so perfectly. And I usually hate Doug Hutchison's roles (mainly because he plays evil characters) but I just found him so adorable in this. A beautiful film.</p><hr><p><b>inganga</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Excellent. I cried a lot through this movie. I am handicapped myself (not like him but deaf) so I know what Sam must have gone through.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am Sam. I've seen this movie about 4 times over the last 10 years. This movie has love all over it. I cry every time. I thought my heart was stone cold before I watched it again tonight.- this movie broke right through. To love like this. This is what truly matters. To love like this.</p><hr><p><b>Kasper</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I am Sam; The best film that I've ever seen ever. It's also the only film, that ever made me cry. EVER! I am Sam simply is a brilliant film, and if you haven't allready seen it You shouldt do it right away. The film touched me deep inside, in a place I didn't even know existed. Throughout the whole film I cryed. I didn't cry when I watched ET, NO FILM HAS ACTUALY EVER MADE ME CRY. But, I am Sam made my room an ocean. Such an amazing storyline combined with all those beautiful beatles-songs. Best film I've ever seen /hug.</p><hr><p><b>zsofi horvath</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best films I' ve ever seen. Strong characters, amazing actors, great plot. Thank you and congratulations.</p><hr><p><b>Fairy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVED IT! I want other films like this to be made, not films that contain violence and are not worth watching! This is such an emotional movie, and it made me cry a lot because I usually don't. Why don't they make movies like this?</p><hr></td>
