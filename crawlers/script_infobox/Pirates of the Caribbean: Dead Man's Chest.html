    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Layleena</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>What can I say? I was really looking forward to this because I loved the 1st one so much. But I saw this and was anticipating something with rich plot but Dead Mans Chest was just really lacking in good dialog. Plus the ending was horrible and WHY did Jack get eaten? Blah. It wasn't my favorite.</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was GREAT! But Pirates of the Caribbean was better. I think Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom did a great job in this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Layla</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Was really long but good!</p><hr><p><b>Strt</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Superb, outstanding. Movie of the Year?</p><hr><p><b>GORE</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie. However, this script seems to be flawed and is missing many lines (for example, in the scene where Jack Sparrow talks to Bootstrap Bill, only Jack's lines are shown). It would be nice if someone would make efforts to fix this.</p><hr><p><b>allan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Layleena, you're forgetting one important thing. He's Captain Jack Sparrow.</p><hr><p><b>Spaz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie I've seen so far this year. Easily a 10.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Incredible movie, I could not say enough about it so why try? I'm so excited that the script is finally here!</p><hr><p><b>Emilee</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved this film, it was great. I don't think it was as good as the first 1 but still great. I LOVE JOHNNY DEPP!</p><hr><p><b>Sahra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. Orlando Bloom is so beautiful and Johnny Depp is beautiful too. Keira Kneightley is so cool and she did a good job!</p><hr><p><b>Angelus Charmed Again</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie, it wasn't as great as the first one because it was really light and the first one was more dark in the plotline.</p><hr><p><b>Helene</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>While this is a wonderful movie, one of my personal favorites actually, this screenplay on here is missing many lines. I had only gotten to the part where Lord Cutler is arresting Will and Elizabeth and Mr. Swann had not said anything when he has really said many things, and Will and Elizabeth both say "Captain Jack Sparrow" and many of Will's lines are missing.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>A solid popcorn flick, but really nothing special. The first is superior.</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It was alright, the effects of Davy Jones and a few characters are exciting - but the issue with Jack has me torn. But I guess we shall see what #3 does!</p><hr><p><b>keidy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's really a good film! I loved this second one as much as the first episode. But my dear Captain Jack Sparrow was trapped by the accursed Eliz! I believe in the third one Jack must have a greater performance and don't forget to take revenge on Elizabeth! Johnny Depp really acts Jack so consumately.</p><hr><p><b>allisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A good movie, but there are some errors in the script (i.e. many of Bootstrap Bill's lines are missing so it seems a bit like Jack is talking to himself). It would be nice if those things were fixed, but overall a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Vivian</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I must admit, as much as I loved the first one (and still do), this film let me down. Big time. Special effects? Blah. I want the thing that made the first movie so great. Captain Jack Sparrow. He has a part, I'm not saying that, but, the special effects steal the show.</p><hr><p><b>Celsia</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is easily the summer's best movie but the script here is full of mistakes. There's a lot of dialogue missing so the conversations aren't very coherent and makes it look like the characters are talking to themselves. Also, in some places in the script it has some characters saying the wrong line etc. It would be wonderful if someone could go back and fix up the script. As for the actors, Johnny Depp was fantastic as always and Keira Knightley was wonderful. Also, I think Orlando Bloom has improved dramatically since Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. I absolutely cannot wait for the third installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><hr><p><b>Steve</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Like oh my gosh! It doesn't matter how hot you think Jonny, Orlando or Keira are. It's like, supposed to be a comment on the script. So, like totally, the script isn't that great. Kind of repetetive. Just a bland middle of a trilogy.</p><hr><p><b>Orthan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like it so much, it's better than The Curse of the Black Pearl in my opinion. Johnny Depp is better, and Keira and Orlando. But, I don't like this script. It has mistakes, and the structure is poor. Besides, my congralutations to the writer.</p><hr><p><b>volsung</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Good script, love the dialogue, but there were some gaps in the script that were confusing. Plus Will is labeled as *Jack* in the action. Did they submit the script like this?</p><hr><p><b>shrimp</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It rocked! Best movie ever. Script is fine.</p><hr><p><b>Meng Hon</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A really nice flim! I like to see Jack acting. It's the movie of the year.</p><hr><p><b>olivia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so good I love the first and second and am so going to see the third. It's my favorite movie ever!</p><hr><p><b>Meike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is fantastic. The first one blew me away, I can't even begin to describe how much I liked the second, I can't wait till the third. I watched it two times now, both in england, sunday night and on tuesday night, just wanted to see it again. The second time really helps you understand it better, the things you didnt get the first time you watched it all of sudden become clear and it makes more sense. The movie look very realistic, in points where you know where a computer graphics have been used. I was really impressed. The script itself is terribly funny. The heart and soul of both movies is definitely Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Especially at the end, Jack's last scene was perfect. It is the perfect end for him (if it is). Also jokes that occur in the first movie, like in the prison with the dog, the rum and Elizabeth are repeated and it really brings you the feeling which you expected from the movie. I love that the old characters other than the main three survived it to the next film. It's a shame, but I didn't see those boat guards! (my favourites) when I hear other peoples opinion about the movie. The thing they found most funny was when Jack told them to leave his hat and the crew went in shock. This movie is just great.</p><hr><p><b>MilZ</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Script was a bit off at times, but the movie was awesome.</p><hr><p><b>lil</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>AVAST! I never thought I would say this but thank god for Orlando Bloom in this film. Don't get me wrong I love the man, I've loved him ever since I saw him in the lotr trilogy, but I haven't seen him act well since his performance in Ned Kelly. Here however he is the only reason for me to see the movie again. I really thought I was going to faint when they tore off his shirt :p His acting was better and he was beginning to be more of a man than the prissy boy he was in the first movie. I love love loved the 'I can join the circus' joke ragetti makes, my friend and I just couldn't stop laughing but we seemed to be the only ones in the cinema. What a brilliant joke and what a lousy audience. Johnny Depp's Sparrow act started the annoy me a bit and I'm not even going to mention Keira knightly although it was quite funny when she pretend-fainted and not one of the guys even noticed it. And I'm only going to mention the fight scene on the wheel because it was so bloody ridiculous, it was stupid, too many coincidences, too much rolling around witout anyone falling down. The story was just weak but that's what's to be expected from a movie with a sequel, that wasn't intended to be one (see the matrix). I also don't understand why they call these movies a trilogy. Dead man's chest had little to do with the first movie, why don't they call it what it is. The first movie brought in a ridiculously huge amount of money, so to make even more money they made a so called trilogy. Clever of course, and nice for the fans. One last thing: Naomie Harris is a priceless asset to this movie. She plays her character very well, I love her in this movie. The movie was good entertainment but if you have to choose between a night on the town with your friends or this movie, go shake your ass off! So basically thank you Orlando and thank you Naomie. Arrr maties!
I'm going to hide now from all the hordes of POtC fans.</p><hr><p><b>Jasmine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely loved it. It was a little long but eh. As long as there's Jack I can stand the length. The end completely shocked me, I so did not expect that. Cannot wait for the next one.</p><hr><p><b>me</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the Commodore!</p><hr><p><b>i,m okay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Parv, this movie was too comedy, johnny depp before the interval and after the interval= all comedy the members of flying dutchman were amazingly real althought they were CGI. Array.</p><hr><p><b>U wannna knoe why ?</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It wasn't the best .
It wasn't the worst .
The ending really disapointed me though .
WHY!?!? lol 
I got to say somin was differnt, and worst about Keria. 
But all in all it's in a okay- good film .
P. S. Orland Bloom is still hott though =p.</p><hr><p><b>melissa</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>It's quite difficult to read this script when a whole character is cut out of the scene. My rating may be inaccurate since I couldn't get past the first scene. By the way, I would like to add that Johnny Depp is a sexy pirate.</p><hr><p><b>Sahra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this film and the script, so 11 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>joy-anne</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I hated the ending but the first half of the story was excellent and very funny. And Mr.'s Depp and Bloom added a whole lot to the movie!</p><hr><p><b>T_gurl</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Norrington was so great in this one and ten times more sexy than in the first. But then who doesn't love a hot drunk brit with a voice like "caramelized sex"!? Davenport made this flix for me. Depp was brillaint as always. Story was acceptable for a second installment in a trilogy, so-so. All in all I loved it and can't wait for my dear Norry in the third movie!</p><hr><p><b>Rory</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was briliant, especially being a sequel. It followed the first movie well and answered a few questions. And for that leeyla person, Captain Jack might have gotten eaten but he'll be back in Pirates of the carrabian 3: At worlds end.</p><hr><p><b>Salomi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was brilliant! I loved it from the beginning to the end! But WHY did Captain Jack Sparrow get eaten? So unfair seeing as how gorgeous Johnny Depp is. Orlando Bloom is gorgeous too, they did a REALLY good job in this movie. I knew I would like it because I liked the first one SO much! I don't really know if I like what starts going on between Captain Jack and Elizabeth because it kind of freaks me out. I mean she's got Will so WHY would she want two guys? That part makes me kind of sad for Will but if you look at it in a different way it makes the movie juicy too if you know what I mean! Can't wait for the third one to come out!</p><hr><p><b>Sohil</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I think this movie was great but it was a little too long. I also like how Orlando Bloom acted as Will Turner.</p><hr><p><b>hollie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think it was so funny, they really thought of the storyline too.</p><hr><p><b>Jes</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was SO great, I wish to see it again very soon. Jack is even better than in the first Pirates movie of his. I can't wait for the third movie to come out!</p><hr><p><b>Idril</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yo, this movie was da bomb! A great follow up to POTC 1! It had a little less gore and more action but it's all good.</p><hr><p><b>Tim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie. I was a little skeptical before going in, but coming out I was fully satisfied. I loved it! It was a good one from beginning to end. But the script seems to be missing some lines.</p><hr><p><b>Dd</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The first film was outsanding, and still is. I thoroughly enjoyed the sequel also, yet nowhere near as much as the first. Dead Mans Chest starts off 'bittier' and slowly comes together which lets the plot down slightly. That's the only down side to the film. Everything else is great. Especially Johnny Depp (SUPERB !) - but I wouldn't expect anything else. I thinks it's sort of depressing how Cap'n Jack's true enemy is the one who has to save him though, plus I was breathtaken at Elizabeth's actions. I now have a distinct hating for Keira Knightly. Luckily I believe in karma. Bring on the 3rd!</p><hr><p><b>Limey</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>How about, as the title for the second sequel, Pirates of the Caribbean: Keira's Heaving Chest? I know it wouldn't be strictly accurate, since she has knockers like fried eggs, but it's just a suggestion. And since the franchise appears to have prematurely capsized with this second installment, a bit more of that pale-skinned, scrawny arsed boarding school trollop might be just what's called for to get male audiences' sail a blowin'.</p><hr><p><b>Sierra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was amazing! I saw it 3 times. They did a great job but I wonder what's going to happen with Will and Elizabeth. I can't wait til the third one comes out! I loved all the movies of Pirates of the Caribbea. I can't wait to see what happens in the 3rd movie!</p><hr><p><b>Swaroop</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Superb movie. Loved Davy Jones in the movie.

But Jack, I want to know if his crew will be able to find him.</p><hr><p><b>Josh</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ahoy mateys! What can I say about this movie? I say a job well done and one of the best that I have seen in a while. It's well worth seeing over and over again until you get bored with it. The special effects were superb and breathtaking and really like how they made Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman. The acting was great and so was the dialog. Can't wait to see the third.</p><hr><p><b>Ali</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Carribean 2 was good but could have been improved. I think Curse of the Black Pearl was better. I think Captain Jack Sparrow should not have died. But Davy Jones and his crew's costume and make up were really good. The sword fighting was brill. It was good to see Will's father. Can't wait for the third.</p><hr><p><b>Smg</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the most wonderful movie that I've ever seen.

I don't think this movie should be compared to the first, but should be watched as part of the first. Once they are all out they should all be watched as one long film in several parts! Johnny Depp rules, with Orlando and Keira close behind.</p><hr><p><b>Ezgi</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Not as good as The Curse of The Black Pearl, liked it though. Do you REALLY believe that Captain Jack Sparrow actually died? I don't think so.

I enjoyed it so much I went to see it like 5 times. Johnny depp is just the best actor in the world and he has shown his talents to the best in the film. Terry and Ted are just amazing writers. I think it was so cool how they brought Barbossa back at the end and how Captain Jack Sparrow got eaten. There is only one word for it, FANTASTIC! By the way Amy, Davy Jones was completely animated. There was no costume!</p><hr><p><b>sara</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best movie ever made! Best part: the kiss between Keira and Johnny.</p><hr><p><b>Random</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Love the movie - but it's much darker then the first film I felt.</p><hr><p><b>elise</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Johnny Depp, he is so good in the movie. I wish I was in it.</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was the most amazing movie ever to be seen (apart from the first pirates). I loved how the jokes from the 1st one were carried on to the next one, like "Elizabeth! Hide the rum!" and "why is the rum ALWAYS gone." and probably a lot more. Johnny Depp is the best actor in the whole movie, and he's SO hot. Most people just go to see Pirates for Orlando Bloom, but if Johnny wasn't in the movie it would be way worse and nothing near what it is. Johnny makes it so much better with his sarcasm and jokes and he's just so amazing and "darn good looking". I know for a fact Jack Sparrow didn't die in the second movie at the end, because it specifically says that he's in the third movie, and plus you can't have a movie without the main character and he clearly is the main character. I love him. Now I'm just rambling on but the third movie is definitely going to be a HUGE hit. And for all you pirates fans, if you read the issue of PEOPLE Magazine with the review for Dead Man's Chest, you would be pissed because they made fun of Jack Sparrow's run! It's the cutest run ever!</p><hr><p><b>Aquamarine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Most people I talk to didn't like Dead Man's Chest, although I don't know why. Jack was just as funny, hot and confusing as before; Will was cute and just as devoted to Elizabeth. Plus Norrington was MUCH better than in the first one (I don't really go for the whole white-wig-polished-shoes-perfect-manners type).
My only complaint is that we have to wait till next May to see Jack come back! Because he IS coming back; the movie would completely suck if he didn't. So my advice to all you non-lovers of PotC 2: Just watch it again. The script is not wooden and the acting does not suck.</p><hr><p><b>amanda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie and just totally fell for Johnny! He IS "Capt. Jack sparrow". I wouldn't mind being stranded on an island with him. Now where is that monkey, I need to shoot something!</p><hr><p><b>jackvasc</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>First of all, I'd like to say to all those that rated the movie good or excellent that they are unfortunately blind. Let simply experts talk. Now listen. The movie is purely and merely a commercial movie, that is, its unique and sole intention is to make as much money as possible (too materialistic and too capitalist an approach that turns out to be immensely vulgar). The end of the movie proves the fateful and sad intention of the producers to make a third part. Help us, please! And thus, reveals a jewish interest in collecting more, more, more money. How sad. Movies upon the service of capitalism. The dialogues are poor, conventional and stereotyped. The female protagonist should be doing the dishes at home and taking care of their children and husband instead of making movies. She is the worst actress that I have ever seen on the screen. And I have seen many, many movies. (I am a 65-year old communist New Yorker). Johnny Depp is bound to be a tiny flower promptly to be blighted as soon as he stops drawing the audience's attention. He is simply a totemic symbol destined to heat the female teenagers' feeble and idiotic minds.</p><hr><p><b>Count D</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Truly a fortuitous circumstance that a sequel was made. Having seen it four times, the above script is faithful. But where are that mouldering maggot Bootstrap's lines? In the first film, characters say that Will 'looks just like him' (Raises right perfectly shaped eyebrow). Anyone think they're 'telling the truth?'.</p><hr><p><b>Amit</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I like this movie too much. Array.</p><hr><p><b>Captain Reed</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I enjoyed this film thoroughly. I'm not quite sure what a lot of you are thinking when you say it was poor, or you didn't like it, but not everyone likes the same things. Having seen the film four times, I think it's safe to say I'm a lover of all things piratical. This installment of the film as many of you have stated, I'll admit, was not QUITE as brilliant as the first but it lived up to my expectations. To condense all the wonderful things I have to say about this film: The action was amazing. The way they brought Davy Jones, his crew and the Kraken to life was amazing. The ending was BRILLIANT. To quote Tia Dalma- "If y'gonna brave the weird and haunted shoals at World's End. Then y'need a captain who knows those waters". That brought CHILLS to my spine. The moment I heard the tell-tale footsteps of Barbossa thumping down the staircase, I put two and two together. He was back. And to all those who assume our boy Jack is dead. You forget one thing: He's Captain Jack Sparrow. And to the people worried about the kiss between Elizabeth and Jack: It had to be done. I could understand her reasonings. She doesn't want Jack, she loves Will, you sillies. She saw no other way to get him to stay and knew the Kraken was after him. But no worries. Jack'll pull through. He's Jack Sparrow for a reason. Ta! ~Captain Reed, Lady Pirate~</p><hr><p><b>Sonya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this one as much as the first. And how come the script shown on here doesnt have Govenor Swann and Bootstrap Bill talking? It's kind of annoying.</p><hr><p><b>Kassie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that the movie was so awesome because Orlando Bloom is so freaken hot and the girl Elizabeth is a good actor. Johnny Depp is so cool in all of his movies.</p><hr><p><b>sheryl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved part 2, the fact that they had all the same characters back and used actual folk lore is great. I definitely give it 10 stars.</p><hr><p><b>Tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was the best movie of the summer, two thumbs way up.</p><hr><p><b>llama lover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You have to love this movie "it should be a dress or nothing and I happen to have no dress in my cabin". Also "hide the rum". It's a feel good thing and the ending cliffhanger rocked.</p><hr><p><b>quack</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You dumb people have to stay after the credits. Everyone's angry because Barbosa is back. If you stayed after the credits in the first one, the monkey dude took some coins out of the chest. Barbosa is back. And Jack didn't get swallowed by the Krakken. He went in it to kill it. Savvy?</p><hr><p><b>Toni</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Good movie. Loved it. But in the next movie could you possibly kill off Orlando Bloom and get Keira Knightly and Johnny Depp together? That kiss at the end was hot, and Orlando always plays a pussy. Keira's more of a naughty girl, and Johnny is perfect for her.</p><hr><p><b>Belladonna Casanova</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry, but such a huge budget film had no excuse to end on a cliffhanger, it degrades the entire film. A few good one-liners, but the plot has more holes than a paper doilie.</p><hr><p><b>mr t</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I hate it. It is godawful.

Nothing but a popcorn flick.</p><hr><p><b>storm.x.rain.x.cloud</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Wow. It was great. The ending left me depressed for weeks.

Great movie, 10 out of 10.</p><hr><p><b>Miss Sparrow</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! The guys were really hot and the script was hilarious. I didn't like the ending much because I have to wait until next summer to find out how it ends, but I am sure that Jack will come back (I mean, they brought Barbossa back, and all these characters seem to be living for eternity- of course, they do that so they can make an eternal amount of movies about them!). Everyone did a good job acting and I'm glad that they brought back Pintel and Ragetti! Of course, Jack was hilarious. Both the leading men are hot hot HOT. The sets are great of course and the shishkabob thing on canibal island and the hamster wheel at the end was hilarious! So was the part when they were trapped in cages. It was a little long, but that's a GOOD thing! My only problem was that the camera was all over the place during the 3-way sword fight, so I didn't really see that much of the action (I know I'm being picky). I went to see it in French on the premier day, because I couldn't wait a whole month (the voice over actors were HORRIBLE)! Then I saw the real thing a month later, and the theatre was still full (I had trouble finding a seat). The actual script in the movie was amazing. I haven't read the one here yet. I loved all the jokes and funny comments they make like "why is the rum always gone", "mind the boats" and the whole Bible conversation. There was no problem with the dialogue, and I kind of liked the confusing plot, because it was so different from most movies, but I can see how that might annoy people.</p><hr><p><b>abhishekanindya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was really too much.</p><hr><p><b>ali</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I liked the 2nd one better.</p><hr><p><b>wynter neel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie and the script.

Anyways I hope the third movie is just as good.</p><hr><p><b>Amy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>POTC 2 is really good but I like the first one a tiny bit better. And out of 10 marks, I give both the POTC movies. 40/10!</p><hr><p><b>liz</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wow, Pirates 2. Not as fantastic as the first one (because of just ridiculous  scenes, like the one with Jack and the fruits or the music when Will and that's what's left of Sparrow's crew swing in these cages) but definitely great! (because of scenes like the one with Elizabeth and Will in jail, or this absolutely insane line of Jack's "as a Captain I could perform a marriage" and "persuade me"). But I think the CGI could have been better, watch LotR or even Pirates 1 and you'll know what I mean: these cursed pirates or whatever, naming themselves Davy Jones' crew were, well, not so great. Whatever, Johnny and Orlando did certainly rock! I was surprised, the Commodore did too. Even if he didn't look as unbelievably hot as the other two guys. Oh, and I loved the ending! Not meaning that poor Captain Sparrow was eaten by big squid, but Gibbs, Ragetti, Pintel, Cotten plus Parrot, Elizabeth and sweet Will agreeing to sail to the End of the World and beyond to save Jack. And then suddenly- Boots, legs, rather ugly face- but nevertheless the person I've missed: Barbossa with Monkeyjack AND apple! "what's become of me ship?" Aaaand cut! Just great! Well, so far I watched it 4 times, two times in German (which sucked, the german voices are just horrible, and you even don't get some jokes, because they're translated in a wrong way!) and two times in English (which was just GREAT! I mean, Johnny and Orlando have just the most sexy voices imaginable!).</p><hr><p><b>Helga</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Captain Jack Sparrow drives me crazy!

Handsome, but annoying!</p><hr><p><b>Will's Pirate Princess</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I actually thought that this was just as good as the first! I was so happy that Orlando was more of a star in this one, and not as prissy as he was in the first. He has one gorgeous back. And face. And everything else. Johnny is like the hottest guy in the world and is also the best actor I think there will ever be. He completely transforms for all of his roles. He is amazing. Orlando and Johnny make a really good team and have good chemistry. Keira? Gosh, That's what ruined it for me. She's not a pirate! Why should she be acting like one? But, I loved loved loved this movie! I saw it 6 times and can't wiat for the third one. 
Orlando + Johnny = the best team ever.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Great movie! Not as good as the first one though so I give it like a 9 out 10. All the actors were great. I liked how Keira took on more of the heroine role in this movie. Orlando Bloom was better, more manly. Just to add one last thing the best part of the movie was NOT the kiss between Elizabeth and Jack, there could have been a better way for her to distract him. And Norrington's role this time was a bit scary.</p><hr><p><b>danielle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>AMAZING! What else can I say. I loved all the bits about the jar of dirt and Johnny Depp just performed like a child in this, it was so funny.

I was sitting on the edge of my seat and I loved all the action.  Johnny was great, of course! It was really good, but I was just expecting something more. It was a great plot, and I can't wait for the 3rd one! I don't know, I just think I was expecting something different.</p><hr><p><b>Morgan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Wow! What a movie. It was so brilliant. Johnny Depp is the best actor of our time. Really, apart from the length, what bad can you say about this movie? I have to say though: pen pops, I kind of agree with you about Will. He's a bit of a stick. Overall, though, a brilliant movie. Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The first time I went to the theaters to see this it was a bit confusing because I did not look closely to catch the brief shot of Barbossa and still do not get the concept of the liar's dice game. But I did think it was HILARIOUS when Jack tells Gibbs to "hide the rum" because he probably did not want Elizabeth to see it and possibly get rid of it as she did in the first movie. Also how Jack quickly put the blame on Will for Norrington getting to the way he was in this movie and how he was still rooting for Norrington.</p><hr><p><b>Carino Lvr 21</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was just as good as the first. Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are HOT! Keira Knightley did a great job (especially in the sword fighting sequence). My favorite scene was the wheel! I love Pirates and anyone that doesn't is stupid. I mean come on! Who WOULDN'T Like a movie with Orlando, Johnny and Keira in it. If someone doesn't like it, they need brain surgery. Can't wait for number 3.</p><hr><p><b>beth</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, it has a great storyline and great casting.

I went. Twice, as a matter of fact, and loved it both times. I quite enjoy movies that don't rely heavily on too many special effects, blood and gore, and big explosions. I thought the plot was good. Admittedly, it could have been better, but it was good. Johnny Depp's reprised role as the swaggering savvy Jack Sparrow was amazing. Just when you think he's crossed the line, he comes up with something else even more extraordinary and hairbrained. 
Oh, and this is for Miss Layleena up top: if you watched closely, it was only suggested that Jack was eaten. He never actually entered the krakken's mouth.</p><hr><p><b>Will'sGurl01</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought it was absolutely the best movie since the first one!

I loved the ending and can't wait for the 3rd. Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are Hot!</p><hr><p><b>kel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was great, I loved it. I'm so happy that Barbossa is back, woot he is almost my favorite pirate.</p><hr><p><b>krista</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I loved how Orlando played his character. Johnny didn't do bad either. Just for you jackvasc, since you think Keira is the worst actress ever, I'll have you know she was nominated for an Oscar last year and you obviously don't know what a good movie is.</p><hr><p><b>madness g</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I just love it.</p><hr><p><b>Miss Sparrow</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I already posted once, but I noticed some questions people have about the liar's dice game, the kraken, and comments about Keira Knightly. The kraken does not actually eat Jack in the movie, just like SparrowAtHeart said mentioned before. My mom pointed this out to me when we went the second time (she loves Pirates, too). I read the book before I saw the movie because I thought that the only chance I would get to see it would be in French in Quebec. The book explains Liar's Dice. People roll the dice, and the person with the highest number wins. You can lie about your score, but people have to guessed if you lied or not. If they guessed that you lied, but you told the truth (like Will did the first time), you win. If they guess that you lied, and you did- you lose (like Will and Bootstrap did the second time). In my opinion, Keira Knightly is a good actress, but I didn't like the part when she was sword fighting because you didn't really get to see her fight. All you got to see was her getting the two swords. I'm disappointed to say that I heard rumours that Orlando Bloom is leaving the Pirates series because he wants more money and they won't pay him (like Hilary Duff with Lizzie McGuire). I hope this isn't true! If anyone knows anything, could you please tell me! It is mostly Johnny's movie, but Orlando's character is great, too. Like most of you, I'm glad that Barbossa is back. He was a great villain for the first movie, and I love his accent, and his apple eating habits! According to my mom, Elizabeth will end up with Jack Sparrow, but my friend thinks that it will be Will Turner. I don't have a prediction. I noticed that Annamaria was not in Pirates 2, but if she were to find out that Jack is married to another girl, she'll be very angry (and she'll slap him). Still, I don't think that Will has it in him to forgive her after he saw the kiss, and I'm not sure if she loves Will anymore. I can tell that she lusts after Jack, but she would never be able to handle Jack's pirate life and his unfaithfulness. I just hope she doesn't end up with Commodore Norrington after the way he betrayed them. I am not saying this to snub Jack Davenport. He is a great actor and I loved his transformation from the first movie to the second and the way he made the same character so different. I also think that he was a great movie villain. I'm just saying that Norrington doesn't deserve Elizabeth any more.</p><hr><p><b>Marquise</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>Hey, here comes Johnny Depp! Oh, I better cream my jeans, I see Johnny Depp on my television screen! Oh my god, I think I just *did* cream my jeans because I saw Johnny Depp on my flippin' television screen! Please folks, I beg of you, somebody with some sense about them tell me why Johnny Depp is so loved. Don't say HE'S SO HOT, no he isn't. Don't say HE'S THE GREATEST ACTOR EVER, no he's not, he's far from it. Don't say JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HIM DOESN'T MEAN HE SUCKS, yes, it does, I am the man, what I say goes. So somebody PLEASE explain to me why he is so hot, and PLEASE give me a reasonable answer that isn't bogus. Now, with that out of the way, if I could forget about Johnny Depp, this movie wasn't all too bad. I mean, sure it had its flaws, but doesn't every movie in the world? Now, the fact that Johnny Depp is in it kind of lowers its rating, but other than that human waste of space, it was still pretty good.</p><hr><p><b>kristelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Not as good as the first movie.</p><hr><p><b>Disney Girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It was too good for words and I really didn't think Barbossa was coming back!

"I got a jar of sand and guess what's in it?".</p><hr><p><b>Rob Stevens</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>This film was poor, it was made to roll in profits from the first, far superior film as so many follow on films do. Jack sparrow was a quiet shadow of the original and the script was lacking in substance and humour which made the first film a success. The ending, when it finally arrived was such a let down how anyone can say it deserves 10/10 I don't know. Too long, too far and two too many.</p><hr><p><b>Daniel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>How the hell do you play that dice game?!?

Absolutely the film of the year. Loved Capt. Jack Sparrow from top to bottom. Didn't even know 3 hours were gone when I saw the film. My fave scene was when they landed on the strange island and Jack was made king. Ha, ha, ha. Do you think he's going to snatch Keira Knightley from Orlando Bloom? Methinks that's what would happen in the third part of the film, cos most definitely Jack.. sorry Captain Jack isn't dead.</p><hr><p><b>Sarah</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Not as good as the first mainly because it's stopped being somewhat original. However, I did think that Orlando Bloom did a slightly better job acting wise (It wasn't the same look of confusion every time he was reacting). The ending was totally a surprise so I have to give it props for that. I can't wait to get it on special 2-disc DVD for Christmas and watch all the extra features and commentary.</p><hr><p><b>Sahra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely love this movie, it's so cool.</p><hr><p><b>Movie Freak</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. Could never decide which was better, first or second. It might be one of those trilogies where the first and third are the best and the second ends up being not as great. It had awesome special effects and a quite a few funny bits, but I just don't know if it was better.</p><hr><p><b>Brandon Irish</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pirates of the Caribbean the Dead Man's Chest is a fun movie for a family to watch. It is exciting and funny. I think the next movie is also going to be awesome, I think that there is going to be a much bigger adventure in the 3rd movie.</p><hr><p><b>Madison</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I honestly loved it. Though people think it was bad, I say that's because we now know Jack. In Pirates 1, he was new. Exciting. No one knew what he was going to do next. But now, we know him. We have a good idea what he, as a character, might do so we don't really like it as much. Also, sequels rarely live up to their predecessor. The ones that do are the ones in the hall of fame. Finally, this was a set up for the third movie, I think. This is a trilogy so they need to present the story this time around, finish it in the third with character development goodies all in between! And people. Jack is dead, BUT HE'S going to GET BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE!</p><hr><p><b>Pirate23</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is a really awesome movie it had me counting down the days to its release. My favourite bit is when he is about to be cooked but he jumps free then flips accross the canyon and falls back had me laughing for ages.</p><hr><p><b>Deearna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved it, it was the best film. After watching it for the thousandth time I started putting heaps of pictures of Pirates of the Caribbean (Johnny Depp) around my room. The ending was really weird but cool. Also sad because for a second you think Jack's dead but he comes back to life. I have seen pictures of the 3rd one and they look like they go to China or something because they all get dressed up in these weird clothes.</p><hr><p><b>JackSparowwlover</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was one of my all time favorite movies ever! But I hated that Elizabeth kisses Jack Sparrow, she belongs with Will. Leave Jack Sparrow alone! But besides that it was so cool with all the flips and stuff and it was wicked funny.</p><hr><p><b>Mohammed</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THIS ROCKS! How did the pirate that used to own the Black Pearl still be alive!?</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ok for those still wondering about Liar's Dice I will attempt to explain. What they are playing in the movies is Liar's Dice Common Hand. The idea is that players bid on the total of a specific face (number) on the table, not just their own dice, hence the four 4's. On your turn you can either raise the bid or call someone a liar. To raise the bid you must either increase the total of the face, e. G five 4's or increase the face e. G two 5's (you can't decrease on either so from this point you could not say one 5 or seven 4's) If a player is challenged (called a liar) all the dice are revealled if the player has less than or equal his/her bid the challenge is defeated however if the bid is more than appear on the table the Liar call is upheld .

Hopefully I have explained this clearly.</p><hr><p><b>i luv jack liz will n tia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm getting my mom a jar of dirt for Christmas (no lie I really am!).

The script was missing a little bit, but that's ok. I don't know why everyone says that it was too long. When I went to see in theaters the first time (yes I went to see it more than once.) I didn't even realize how much time went by. I was eagerly awaiting to see how Barbossa was going to help them when the screen went black & the lights came back on.</p><hr><p><b>Ashlee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie. It's my favorite movie so far. I think they had a lot of cool special effects and Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were so much hotter in this movie. I can't wait until the 3rd one comes out. I totally give this one a 10. Duh. I'm only wondering one thing. How the hell is barbossa still live?! That's crazy. 
and one last thing. I don't think Will loves Elizabeth anymore. That bitch kissed Jack! Well duh they love each other but still. I bet jack is going to be mad at elizabeth when he comes back. She practically like murdered him.</p><hr><p><b>kim</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Thought the movie was funny, scary, and amazing. Jonny depp can do no wrong.

If he did I would be rather disappointed. I'm absolutely SURE that Johnny Depp will be in all of the sequels though cause I read in a magazine that he said "I'm not against a Pirates of the Caribbean 4, 5 or 6" so that made me quite happy.</p><hr><p><b>tat</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I believe it was a wonderful movie considering the amount of time they had to make it. All of the actors/actresses were wonderful, especially Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and, of course, Johnny Depp as *Captain* Jack Sparrow. The crew was wonderful in making this movie incredible. All that is left to say is: bring on the third movie.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think I finally understand all the stuff that went down in this movie. I can't wait to see #3 only to find out if Will and Elizabeth end up together. I sure do hope so. Jack is too gross to end up with Elizabeth. Will is way hotter. Actually I am not sure if Elizabeth loves Will anymore and if she really has a thing for Jack because of what Jacks compass predicts.</p><hr><p><b>Alexi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pirates: What can I say. Jack Sparrow-The funniest person on earth. From his slurred speech, to his hilarious excuses. The only downer about Jack in the movie: he gets eaten by the Kraken. But don't fret! He's Captain Jack. He will get out of it. Will Turner-A true pirate. He is adorable and has some funny points in the movie. Some of his lines are so corny, they're hilarious. I. E. (Pirates 1, to Elizabeth) "I'll accept the consequences of my actions". They crack me up every time. Elizabeth Swann-A beautiful heroine who has a great sense of intelligence and a true pirate attitude. 2 thumbs up, Keira !
I cannot wait for Pirates 3! (Will and Elizabeth better get married!).</p><hr><p><b>Anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What the heck were they thinking?

Didn't like much first time round but after watching it again and again I have to say its really good. Johnny was great as always, love him so much, Kiera was really a load better cus she wasn't so helpless and not nearly as much pouting, Orlando, not as poofy and so much more macho, norrington, the dirty ive-wrecked-my-whole-life look suites him so much better. And the line I loved the most was in Tortuga, and Gibbs sees Norrington, and he says 'Commadore?' and james replies 'No not anymore, weren't you listening?!' in a really upset voice. Lee and Mackenzie (Pintel& ragetti) were, was so glad they were back. All in all, great movie and keep up the great work Jack Davenport you are the best actor in POC.</p><hr><p><b>Noogle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yay me loves this movie.

Jack Sparrow is the greatest! *raises bottle of rum (actually, it's apple juice :D)*.</p><hr><p><b>Jenny</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Those of you shallowminded-enough to call it a poor film, should not be proclaiming it. You will not be respected. The 2nd film is incredible, yes I am another Johnny Depp fan but that is not the only reason I have seen it 56 times! I think the special effects are amazing, those who did not like the movie because of them should not have gone along and seen it- they had said, since they decided to make a second that there main concentration would be on animating (hence the kraken, davy jones, and his crew). Before any of the rest of you even dare to mention that the special effects were poor, just you imagine (if you can) how hard it is to animate a mythical creature. I loved the first movie but this one has raised the bar incredibly, it is excellent! The ending when watching it the first time was slightly dissapointing, but this was probably a result from the shock. Therefore I have come to the conclusion that the ending was amazing. Those of you who are saying, 'Jack Sparrow died but don't worry he is gonna come back from the dead. That is not true'. There is a complication, from the stealing of the heart, and Jack appears in the third movie at Davy Jones' locker. I cannot tell you anymore information as it is strictly confidential. I cannot wait for the third installment, it is coming out on the 25th of May, although it is unknown as to what cinemas will be showing on that date, depending on where you live, you may have to watch it slightly later.</p><hr><p><b>Diana</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Amazing movie but not as great as the first.

Davenport did a great job changing his character so much. Kiera was so much more kick-ass, and pintel and ragetti were back! Best movie of the year, by far!</p><hr><p><b>Emilie</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Like *most* people say, I love this movie! The second one and the first one both really interest me and I yearn for more. I have the 2nd DVD and I'm wanting the first. I will agree with some people though, some things were a little confusing, but once I watched it again I got it. Orlando, Johnny, and Kiera are just awesome. My friends think I'm crazy because everything I own practically has a skull on it. I can't wait till the third one comes out, but hopefully it will still be good because it's hard to make sequels that are actually good. They did great on the first and the second one was really intriguing, but some things didn't make sense. Like in the end of the 2nd, Barbossa was alive. How? They killed him off in the 1st. I don't know. The 3rd will clear it up for me. Yo ho Yo ho A pirates life for me. We pillage we plunder. We rifle and loot. Drink up me hearties yo ho! Yo ho yo ho a Pirates life for me.

His performance makes the movie really special. We hardly see such witty characters and such brilliant story lines anymore. I'll rate the Pirates with 10/10 because I think this is the kind of movie that makes us think nowadays- behind the seemingly plot we find a deep intention.</p><hr><p><b>Jack</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Not bad really. It's pretty decent. It's not as good as "Pearl" but is still an adequate sequel. When I saw the film, I thought it had WAY to many twists and turns throughout.

It looks to me like they did but I'm not sure. And yes I know that her making out with him was a trap but still.

As many people have said, This movie is easily the best movie of 2006. I am also a JD fan, times ten. My rating would have been higher, but obviously you can only go up to ten stars. The ending shocked and slightly disappointed me, but after I had seen it several times, im not that disappointed because there is the last movie coming May 25th, 2007 !~*We're devils and black sheep we're really bad eggs, drink up me hearties yo ho!

I just can't get enough of pirates of the caribbean, I would have to say it's my favorite movie ever, I seen the second one in theaters 5 times in opening week. Whatever they're doing to make these movies they're doing it right. Plus I totally love orlando bloom and johnny depp, they make the movie even better than it already is. Did anyone else hear that there killing orlando at the end of the third and johnny and keira are going to end up together? That would suck, but I would still love it!</p><hr><p><b>Sid</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in the year 2006. I believe it was a wonderful movie considering the amount of time they had to make it. All of the actors/actresses were wonderful, especially Bill Nigh as Davy Jones and of course, Johnny Dippy as *Captain* Jack Sparrow. The crew was wonderful in making this movie incredible. All that is left to say is: bring on the third movie.</p><hr><p><b>Butterflygurl94</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that Will's heart is broken because he saw Elizabeth kiss Jack! She only did it to hand cuff him, but Will didn't know that. I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 3, it will be great!</p><hr><p><b>spaf</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Going to the premiere of the 3rd one, can't wait.</p><hr><p><b>Anthony</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jack was GREAT in this movie! Totally awesome. Has tons of adventure. Keira Knightley played a great part in it too. Can't wait till the third comes out.</p><hr><p><b>Nicole Bowers</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was GREAT! I would suggest this movie to anyone. I can't wait to see the third one.</p><hr><p><b>A</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Pirates Of The Caribbean 2: Dead Mans Chest was awesome! Johnny Depp is the greatest actror ever, Captain Jack Sparrow rules the seas and this movie! Anyone that makes fun of this movie or Johnny SUX!</p><hr><p><b>BECK</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Orlando was so hot in it! But I so totally hate the part when Elizabeth smooches Jack. How dare she cheat on Will. To be honest, I like the first one the best.</p><hr><p><b>Q</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This movie was great. My favorite part was when Johny Depp said "Hide the rum" and when Orlando Bloom said "Never mind let's go!" when Jack came running!</p><hr><p><b>Nickolie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Flawed. Yet still amazing. I don't get it, and I honestly don't care to at this point. Hm, the plot was kind of dry, and Cap'n Jack is repetitive with his facial expressions. Which gets somewhat tiring. Will seems to have. Well, it seemed to me that his part could have been in a fanfiction. I really didn't care for his role at all in this film. And then there's Elizabeth. Dear me, she makes me want to shoot myself more than the others. Keira's acting was great, but her character is a dirty @#$%^. Haha. I could go on about the things that bother me about this film, but I'd much rather say why I'm so in love with it. And his first line is "My story. It's exactly the same as your story just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the seven seas. The pursuit cost me my crew. My commission & my life". Mm that's right, Jack Davenport's character-- former Commodore Norrington. It's the voice. And the facial hair. If there were a main reason to see this film, he would be it.</p><hr><p><b>Hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Jack gets rescued in pirates 3!</p><hr><p><b>Vi</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>All in all this was quite a disappointing movie. Some parts were really good and other parts were not. Johnny Depp was great as Jack Sparrow and I think that most of the disappointment of the film has to fall upon the director/producer. Or whoever made it. The plot was quite weak and the dialogue was trying to be too funny when it shouldn't have been. It was an ok movie but I preferred the first one. It flowed more naturally and the dialogue was funny but realisticly funny. I am dreading the third movie. I think they should have just left the first movie and not made a second one.</p><hr><p><b>Tricia</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This movie is great! Although I do like the first one better. What it needs is some sort of introduction (like why does Captain Jack sparrow look for the dead mans chest anyway? What inspired him to do that and why?) and also the thing with the compass don't make sense. One minute jack don't know what he wants and then the next it leads him staright to it after he makes it plain he fancies elizabeth 
fair enough it was a brilliant film but it was hard to follow and didnt make sense at times.</p><hr><p><b>DM</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Blah. What a disappointment. Not anywhere near the caliber of the first movie. The comedy was often silly and over the top, not nearly as original as Black Pearl. And the "goo and ick" factor on this one made it often genuinely unpleasant. I won't bother buying the DVD this time around.</p><hr><p><b>Kerry</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ok. I watched this film a while ago, but it's still fresh in my mind. I enjoyed it very much, but was angry to see that Elizabeth cheats on Will; especially with Jack. I for one adore Jack; understatement? Maybe !
But how could she do that?! 
And Jack will come back, he has to. It wouldn't be "Pirates of the Caribbean" without him now, would it? Besides, they've gone to get him back. And they will .
I hope Elizabeth gets what she deserves .
Poor Will is going to go crazy !
And Jack, though I love him, he shouldn't be messing with Elizabeth .
I know he was tied up at the end, but before he wasn't. Shameful! :P I'm very jealous of Elizabeth .

10 outta 10 !
Can't wait for the next one!</p><hr><p><b>Ron</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie was great! Great plot, good effects, plenty action, and excellent acting overall by everyone. One thing I didn't like though is how Elizabeth is basically being unfaithful to Will. Even though she wasn't actually physically unfaithful to him until the kiss scene, she still was in other ways beginning with when she said "you do know Will taught me how to handle a sword?" to Jack and then the compass pointed to Jack which means that's what she wanted the most at that moment. And then when she was telling Jack about the rewards of being a good man and about wanting to know what it tastes like she was actually going to make out with him and even more if it wasn't for the fact that Jack saw the black mark start to appear again. What a whore! How could she do that being engaged to a man that is risking his life to save hers. That was messed up! But then again that's what's going to make the 3rd one interesting. To find out how it all turns out. Looking forward to it.</p><hr><p><b>Chloe Depp</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry, but to all of you guys saying that Johnny Depp isn't hot, I think you have mental issues. He is the hottest guy on the planet and any other planets there may be. He makes me melt! I am probably the biggest Johnny fan there is, and I love any movies that he is in. I was so upset at the end of movie when Jack gets eaten. How could anything that hot leave his movie? I am so happy there is a 3rd movie coming out soon, it gives me more time to stare at him! I think Elizabeth does end up with Jack. Even if she does still love Will, Will won't except that! Really, who wouldn't want to roam the seas with Johnny? I mean, sure Will's okay, but Johnny is. Johnny! There are no words to describe him. I would seriously give anything to meet him, I would give anything to get a tissue used by him! If you agree with me, please tell me so! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 19!</p><hr><p><b>Terry</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>OK. I'm not berating you who gave this 9's or 10's. This was a decent movie, with some ok plot advancement from the 1st. But what most of you seem to fail at realizing is that this is just a set-up for the third. You'd probably never have noticed if you had only watched the first and gone straight to the third.</p><hr><p><b>Paula</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE the part where Jack Sparrow jumped into the crakin with his sword. My HERO.</p><hr><p><b>Andy</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The movie was very entertaining. But I do hope that in Pirates 3 they explain how Barbosa came back to life, he was killed in the ending of "The Black Pearl" was he not? Also, I believe when all of the Aztec gold was returned and everyone became mortal because the curse was lifted shouldn't that have included the monkey? Oh well, I still found "Dead Man's Chest" to be wonderfully entertaining, it is refreshing to see swashbuckling films of an era gone.</p><hr><p><b>The Kraken</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Why did Jack get eaten? That sucked, and I thought Barbossa was dead. Why did he come back? That weird Indian girl reminded me of Rihanna, who was it really?</p><hr><p><b>Jenn</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is by far the greatest Pirate movie ever. It shall never be topped by any other, so move over Captain Hook. Jack Sparrow is the new legendary Pirate. Awesome script, great adventure, appropriate for entire family, everything about it was amazing. I can't wait for the trilogy to be complete.</p><hr><p><b>THE PROcrastinater</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Eh, the movie was good. The  CGI was pretty good too. I think it was much too drawn out. I don't think the cannibal island scenes were quite necessary. They really didn't make much sense and didn't go along with the movie's main plot too well. I also think the scenes were Jack, Will, and Norrington fight were way too long and, once again too drawn out and unnecessary. That includes Elizabeth's fight scenes with Davey Jones' crew members. The first movie was very good. It stuck with the main plot and didn't trail off or linger too long. The comedy in the second wasn't very convincing. It's like the writers  couldn't think of anything else to say so they just threw some stuff in there that completely did not make sense and  wasn't funny at all. Jack wasn't portrayed as good in this movie either. Depp is a wonderful actor, don't get me wrong, I just didn't like the way he played the role this time around. It stuck with the rum joke way too much. Mentioning it once would have been a lot better than going on and on about it. It was getting to the point were it just wasn't a satisfying joke any more. It was only funny in the first movie. Bloom and Knightly did a good job as well. I love the way Bill Nighy acts. He truly is a man of a thousand faces.</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Well, even if it is a set up for the third part, the movie is worth watching because it is great. The appearance of the main characters is great, well, I'm not going to mention everything but I loved the movie and to me the movie seems to be even better than the 1st one.</p><hr><p><b>Shmegalah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love everything about COTBP and DMC, and both movies should have got more recognition than they did. But, I cannot wait until At Worlds End!</p><hr><p><b>Cynthia</b> <img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>Overall, I'd say this movie wasn't that special. Slightly funny yes, but nothing special. Depp was the same swaggering drunkard, Bloom whined, and Knightley was a prissy rich girl. In the first film, they were lovable characters. This time around, they were just plain annoying. It was a thrilling movie though. Ultimately, I feel that this film was just a commercial ploy. I still am looking forward to the third movie.</p><hr><p><b>miss_m</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved the movie. Maybe the first one was a little better, but this one was also very funny. Johnny played Jack Sparrow very well. It was great!</p><hr><p><b>Capt Vargas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Aye mates, spectacular tale an out'standin' dialogue. Th' words of ole Davy Jones be spine tinglin' an toe curlin'! Terrible cursed charlatan he be.</p><hr></td>
