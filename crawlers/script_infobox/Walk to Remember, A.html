I love the music she sings in the film. </p><hr><p><b>Lola</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, I've got the DVD and I watch it once a month or sometimes even more :-) It's so good, I love Mandy's voice and Shane West is só Cute!!! And it starts with the normal kind of teen movie thing: Cool boy and Nerdy must do something together, boy in love, happily ever after, BUT NOT IN A WALK TO REMEMBER!!! That's one of the things why I love it! And the end always makes me cry! :'-(</p><hr><p><b>brandy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG THIS MOVIE IS SO GREAT!! i love this move i cry everytime i see it and i have the movie i have read the book and everything i love it!!</p><hr><p><b>Rachel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Absolutely Amazing!!!

I LOVED IT!!!</p><hr><p><b>Cindy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The tears get me everytime i watch this movie even if its the same scene.  Mandy Moore is amazing with Shane West and it made me wonder how i would react if i was in the same situtation.  The movie captured so much life, compassion and love.  *standing ovation* Word of advise: Grab a box of tissues before you watch it! Enjoy!</p><hr><p><b>Cool dude</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I saw this movie 2 times 2 times its way more sadder then the movie called the Titanic!</p><hr><p><b>Becka</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's one of the best movies I ever seen! I've seen this movie more than 20-30 times! But now I've promised to not look at this at a year! haha ;P
And one more movie I like is: the cross and the switchblade.</p><hr><p><b>will</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Hahahahaha!! Has anyone read the book? Lemme be the first to not give the movie a ten. Mandy Moore handled her role well, as easy as it were, and Shane West was a good choice to get the preteen girls coming in the box office.

Good, but not a 10.

Go act out the movie with your friends. The funniest thing ever. This time you won't fight back the tears.</p><hr><p><b>Roberto</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The saddest movie I have ever seen.....i loved every minute of it and it is just as good the 10th time as it is the 1st.....Bravo</p><hr><p><b>ame</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this is the best movie esp 4 teens. its tender n soft which reveals true love. the credit goes to all the members who are a part n parcel for the makin. shane and mandy was just gr8. i watch it over and over again and each time i do there's always new to see.</p><hr><p><b>MaRob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mandy Moore.....was absolutely beautiful in this rendition of a walk to remember.

And to think, I wasn't much of a erm... I never cried too much with these films. Evenmy sister cried. tehee. Hmm Mandy Moore, a break through  really. One would think it's really too hard to wipe out that super star quality but in this film, they did! And her performance was so great I couldn't even believe it was her!

The acting was great. I loved Shane West and Mandy Moore. I mean they had excellent Chemistry. Yet I was never really a Mandy Moore Fan but she was amazing in this movie. It always makes me feel as if i was actually apart of the movie. I was touched in different scenes. I always end up crying at the end.  Like I said thoughm EXCELLENT MOVIE! 
My favorite part of the movie was the Musical. I fell in love with the song that Mandy Moore sang. And when he just realized that he was actually starting to like her! I loved it!</p><hr><p><b>kathleen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love the film I have watched the film everyday for 5 weeks and 6 days.

I cannot tell you how much I love this movie! It's without a doubt the BEST movie I've ever seen! I really love Shane's character. He reminds me a lot of my boyfriend in a good way. And Mandy Moore is so beautiful in this movie. None of my friends like how she downsizes her appearence but I think it just makes her character even more unique and special. They are so perfect for each other in the movie. It would be really cool if they would get together in real life! I would be so jealous! I may only be 15 but I have no problem saying Shane West is the HOTTEST guy on earth! Oh yeah.
</p><hr><p><b>sk8ter babe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie so much! Best ever. The characters were so perfect for the parts. Shane West is so hot, but in a sweet way. Whenever he would cry, so would I. I hate seeing his gorgeous face all sad, makes me burst into tears. I also loved Mandy Moore's character. She's so sweet and confident. Even though I'm not a fan of pop music I really loved her voice and songs. I REALLY hope they get together. It seems like there's alot of chemistry there and they look so sweet together. Oh, and I really love Shane's band, their music rocks!</p><hr><p><b>haley</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'd have to say this is like the best movie I've EVER seen. My favorite parts are when Shane takes Mandy to the state line so she can be in 2 places at once, that was awesome. At the play I love how Shane's (gorgeous) face was all surprised when he saw how hot Mandy could look. And I love the kiss at the play too, it was so sweet and tender.</p><hr><p><b>Sam</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie more than anyone in the world, it is the most amazing movie in ever of evers!</p><hr><p><b>cece</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>So it was like the best movie ever! Shane West is like super HOT, not to mention my favorite actor. But I hate it wen ALL people can talk about is how hot he is, as if his personality doesn't even exist. Well, he's my favorite actor (not only because he's hot) but because he really knows how to take a character and make it his own. He really makes the character come alive and adds personality to it. I think him & Mandy did a great job together. Shane's so awesome. Not to mention his band kicks ass! Is the cd in stores yet? Oh and Sam, if you love this movie more than "anyone in the world" why did you only give it a 5? That's only half the credit it deserves.</p><hr><p><b>NESHREEN</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much.

On last Saturday I was playing softball with my my team and I broke my leg so have basically been watching A Walk to Remember or Mean Girls (more of A Walk to Remember). Well I am a huge Shane West/ Mandy Moore fan, my room has posters and pictures of them both. My mom paid her best friend's boyfriend who's sister is one of those people that you give pictures to and they put it on some kind of cotton. So what I did was, I gave her a picture of Shane West and she did it. She made me a beautiful blanket of Shane West.

That Mandy Moore is so lucky to star in a movie with him in it. I probably should have seen the part when she had sung to him, she said one of the part of the song that I liked the most was "at the top of my lungs I'm giving it back and my head back down and I lift my hands and pray to be only yours and I know you're my only hope".

Just wanted to say the both the movie and book are great as I have seen both and give them both a 10 going on a 11. However until you read the book don't get your hopes up that you'll give it a 10 because film and written work are so very different and cannot be compared. The book is extremely different to the film in so many ways because in written work you can be more descriptive and explain exactly how people are feeling at every moment but movies are more visual and you have to assume what you think they are feeling. So embrace the differences and don't compare them because they're very different ways of storytelling. I know that many people say that they if they read a book they can't see the movie because they won't like it because things have cut out or altered in ways and vice versa, so please keep an open mind and embrace the differences and don't compare. I hope you enjoy the book!</p><hr><p><b>kerry</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No one I know has seen this film but they are missing out on such a lot.

EVERY TIME! And with certain scenes and all I definitely give it a 10. Masterful, brilliant, spectacular, superb, marvelous. I agree on 2 things, Shane West and Mandy Moore would look so cute together and that Shane West is sexy! ;-) Maybe when I'm older and married, I'll name my baby boy Landon. I really do think it's an awesome name for a boy. Good job to the cast and crew!</p><hr><p><b>Baura</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie has burning passions that filll my heart with enthusiasm.

I also reckon it's the best, it's really good not like the rest of the teen movies about sex and drugs. This is an inspireing story that would make you think about whom to look for in your life, the decisions to make and the purpose of why we are on this earth. Very beautiful movie, awesome for couples! My boyfriend had to cheer me up because I was crying like hell! The director said it's not a christian movie, I reckon it is because it gives a whole huge turn to where the cofidence and beauty comes from. Mandy's beauty came from the inside, she reflected it in her pesonality becase she was christian and that is the best way I THINK (maybe not for non religious people). I think it might effect non-believers in some way.</p><hr><p><b>hadeel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hello, I live in israel. I love this movie so much.

How I would love to look like Mandy Moore. Shane West, wow definitely not ugly. Perhaps I shall marry him? Yes. That will totally happen. AMAZING movie, very well put together. The actors, bravo.

Allthough there are many other better love movies, this one has such a big impact on me because I connected with the pure love between Jaime and Landon, the kind of love we  hardly see in movies. I can't stop watching it. The soundtrack is also great.</p><hr><p><b>Kenya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that A Walk To Remember is a good movie. I've seen it a bunch of times and you can't tell me what is a good movie. I mean I JUST love it so much and I have Mandy Moore and Shane West movies at home. I love them both and I can't believe that Shane West is a single man. If I saw him in real life I would just SCREAM! A boy that fine needs his own wife and kids. OH, I'm sorry I was supposed to be talking about the movie. Well um all I have to say is that Mandy Moore and Shane West did their thing in the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Laura</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of my absolute favorites.

It showed me that you should never judge a person without even knowing who they really are. Because at times the unexpected thing might happen like fall in love with someone completely diffrent from you. Then when you are about you lose them you wish you could have been nicer to them as well as getting to know them. But other than that it was a really GREAT MOVIE!</p><hr><p><b>Some girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I watched this film when I was at a sleepover. Claudia (my friend) wept buckets and I did too! We actually had a box of tissues on the table. It's a bit predictable, although it's not common so it's good. Oh, I loved Mandy's song. I listened it over and over again.</p><hr><p><b>Cassy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie ever! If you watch the movie trailer right before watching the movie, you'll think that it's so much different when you actually watch it. I cried so much the first time I watched it, and I swear that I've watched 100 times and I still cry. It was so good that I had to read the book. Shane West and Mandy Moore were absolutely amazing in this movie!</p><hr><p><b>Israa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I can't imagine myself watching this film without crying from the bottom of my heart. This is the 10th time I watch it and I still adore watching it again because every time I discover something new in the meaning and the feeling. The writer is a symbol of this magical feeling that Mandy Moore played excellently; she was the angel of the movie. I wish there would be more movies at this kind of level, really amazing, no words to describe more!</p><hr><p><b>In Love With Being In Luv</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is my all time favorite movie. It is so sad and romantic. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film. As for all of the people who didn't give it a 10, I think that you guys were watching a completely different film. Or you are blind. This movie is anything BUT predictable (some girl) oh and for ofra atsuaha this movie is the best love movie ever. I could not think of one that is better. This movie is just sad because it is based on a true story and there are people out there that are probably living the whole story out as we speak, it is heartbreaking. So for all you people who didn't give it a ten I think that you guys are stupid. You shouldn't even be allowed to watch movies ever again!</p><hr><p><b>in love with eric</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is an amazing movie, sometimes a little too christian but awesome.

Mandy Moore and Shane West should 100 percent get together it is sad saying that because I would love to marry him (he is so cute) but they would be perfect for each other. This movie makes you cry every time you watch it, believe me because I've watched it like 100 times and I'm not even joking that is how good it is. Once you watch it you fall in love with it, it is the most amazing movie in the world. I am addicted to it and it is just so unbelievably cute how good it worked out. I never used to be a big fan of Mandy Moore but I love her songs and acting. She is so pretty. I wish that I was that pretty and that I could be in the arms of a guy as sweet as Shane. Anyway but ya if you haven't seen the movie yet you have to watch it but be prepared with a box of cleanex or 2. And when I read the book it was kinda hard to read because my eyes were so blurry.</p><hr><p><b>sienna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's an amazing love story but it's also relevant to lots of peoples lives.

I totally love it and I really wanna read the book.</p><hr><p><b>louise</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The movie may not be that perfect. Goofs were lurking around the corner, but that's not enough to spoil you from savoring such a coming of age love story. Shane West carried Mandy throughout the film. He proves he's a good leading actor and the role fits him well. There's no other actor who can pull such a role better than Shane and it's impossible to imagine another one. Mandy was good too especially considering the fact that she was a pop singer and was just an amateur actress. Shane and Mandy had such perfect chemistry.</p><hr><p><b>~Shana~</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie! I cried so much. It is way better than The Notebook totally! Shane is so HOT! Awesome movie.</p><hr><p><b>someone</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, I cry so much during it! It's one of the best romantic movies ever.</p><hr><p><b>Noneya</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, so naturally I checked out this script. It was different from the movie, way different but still good no less. I'm glad in the movie Landon didn't remarry. Because I would have cried harder than I already did. Anyway, this is one of the best movies of all time.</p><hr><p><b>michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is my favorite movie ever! I am so obsessed. I have the dvd and know every line, I have the soundtrack and so many pics of the hottie Shane.</p><hr><p><b>Willow</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Gosh I love this movie, it's so much my fantasy. I didn't know about watching a movie with Mandy in it because I thought she was still a bit "bubble-pop" but she did so well!</p><hr><p><b>ace cool</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A very beautiful movie.</p><hr><p><b>lorrina</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this movie, it's so romantic and I love the storyline it's full of fantasy. Mandy Moore is a great actor and so is Shane West, the guy who acts out Landon Carter. The movie rocks.</p><hr><p><b>Bailey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved that movie. I thought it was fantastic, I just loved the way Mandy Moore and Shane West worked together on the movie. I think it's the best movie going, nothing can top it! It's like I can't get enough of it. It's just awesome, that movie rocks. Very well done.</p><hr><p><b>Some Girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've actually lost count of how many times I've seen it. Every single time it makes me cry. Especially the parts where Landon cried and when Jaime died at the end. Kudos to the people who made the movie. So touching and a major tear jerker.</p><hr><p><b>michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever. I really mean that seriously. I've watched it so so many times and NEVER got bored or sick of it. I haven't read the book though, but I WILL because I'm borrowing it soon. In my opinion, EVERYONE should watch this movie, it's really touching and mesmerising. Shane West and Mandy Moore are the best actors together. They make you feel everything so deeply.</p><hr><p><b>fan of  the movie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Does anyone know what the song is called when Landon gets in the car and starts crying? I love that part.</p><hr><p><b>Tabz</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Both Shane West and Mandy Moore had done a fabulous job. This move makes me feel upset for a few days when I watch it.</p><hr><p><b>kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie still makes me cry even though I have seen it over 100 times.</p><hr><p><b>Keira</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>FABULOUS MOVIE! I love it and everyone I know cries when they watch it. So sad but so awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Tiffany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is my FAVORITE movie of all times! It makes me cry every time I watch it. Jamie and Landon are so cute together. This is one of the BEST love stories EVER! This movie really touched me. Whoever hasn't seen this movie NEEDS to see it.</p><hr><p><b>Nieke</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Love it man! Made me cry.</p><hr><p><b>Emily</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie!

It really touches your heart and it's so good to watch many times.</p><hr><p><b>david snyder</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I know this is going to sound a little sad but I'd been itching to see this movie for a long time and now that I finally have, I loved it. The writing of Nicholas Sparks is amazing and tragically sad. I loved the way that the actors and actresses all brought life to every word. I normally won't cry in front of people but after watching that movie I wept in front of everyone.</p><hr><p><b>stacy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, every time I watch it I sing along with "Only Hope" and always start crying at the end.</p><hr><p><b>Eefa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is the best, I love it. I must have watched it four or five times. Blap!
"Faith is like the wind. You can't see it, but you can feel it".</p><hr><p><b>Shilpa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The most beautiful movie I've ever seen.</p><hr><p><b>Charlotte</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Who gave this the green light? Terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad movie. Just beyond ridiculous. Cringe-inducing. Worst acting I've ever seen. Shane West's face has all the expression of a brick wall. Mandy Moore makes me want to vomit. Among the worst movies I've ever seen. They had no chemistry whatsoever. To those of you who claim it's the best movie ever made- you don't watch many movies, do you? The lot of you must be 13 years old or younger, or just immature. Because there's nothing good about this movie. Nothing. The dialogue was unrealistic, vapid, and laughable. "Your behavior is sinful!" "You have to promise you won't fall in love with me." WTF. Who says that? That's among the weirdest things you can say to a person. Not to mention the most egocentric. It all just makes me gag. And should I even mention the sheer Bible-thumping? Yeah, you read that right. Bible-thumping. The movie's message is, religion= good, no religion= bad. That's it. The guy has no aim in life, why? Because he's not religious! Heck, the guy's as soft-core a bad boy as they come- he doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs. What makes him a bad boy? Skipping school? Ooh. I could not believe what I was witnessing. And what's his motive? *gasp* Divorced parents! What a rough life he's had. Could it be any more cliche? What has cinema been reduced to? It makes me physically ill that it's come to this.</p><hr><p><b>ME.</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This movie ROCKS. It is so awesome and romantic. It teaches people about love and living life with hope and with god present.</p><hr><p><b>moses</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my most favourite movie of all times. I can't just explain, this movie is so meaningful with hope. How I love that music. I loved the song only hope actually it became my favourite. Thanks to everyone who worked towards the completion of this great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Marquise</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Too whiny for me. I have the worlds biggest crush on Mandy Moore and I happen to think that Shane West is amazing, but this is without a doubt the most "boo hoo hoo" crybaby-like movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Sensitive? No thank you. I'll take a nice explosion or a nice murder scene over a crybaby scene, and this one is full of them. Avoid. 1 Star because I got to see the beautiful Mandy Moore.</p><hr><p><b>natasha</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This comment is for him^ ok if you really think the movie was that bad then why bother commenting on it. Did you even read the back of the movie to see what it was about? If you did, then you probably would have seen that there was no murder scene in it. Now come on.</p><hr><p><b>lizzy b</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I'm sorry but this is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. It makes me disgusted so many people could be stupid, gullible or hopeless as to fall for this sickly-sweet cliche. Makes me really sad that so many people cannot see through it. I do not say this because I want to be different, tough, whatever but because it is so see-through with two-dimensional characters. Does no one else feel like retching when they see mandy moore? Too too sweet. People, life is not like this! Get a life and you will see this! If you can relate to or learn anything from this, you need a life. I pity your poor pathetic souls. It is not meaningful. It has no message that most people with any brain should have worked out by preschool age. Be nice to people, stick by them, etc. Go out to the real world and do yourself a favour. I feel like crying when I see this movie- out of frustration! ps. There is no god- but that isn't why I hate this movie.</p><hr><p><b>kristine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my most favorate movie of all times. I can't just explain, this movie is so meaningful with hope. How I love that music. I loved the song only hope actually it became my favorate. Thanks to everyone who worked towards the completion of this great movie that I have seen.</p><hr><p><b>Jessie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is to lizzy b. There is a god. Whether you believe in him or not, he is there and I will be praying for you. Life IS like this. In fact, people get cancer each day and die. Granted, there aren't many Landon's in the world- but people are nice once in a while. You wouldn't know, I'm sure. This movie is a movie about learning, changing, faith and love. It's about finding someone you can spend the rest of your life with. It's about having such a deep faith in something that you are content to lose your life, even if it means leaving behind everything you love. I could only hope to have such a strong faith in god as Jamie Sullivan does- and there are people like that, in the world. This is my absolute favorite movie. I love the religious details, I love the true love. I hope one day, I'll find someone to share my life with like that. Everyone does. Shane West and Mandy Moore are excellent in this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Cynthia Lemery</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that a walk to remember is the best romantic movie that is on Dvd and video. I would never get sick or tired of the movie unless I read the novel by the best selling novel by Nicholas Sparks. It is sad and romantic in every scene when they are together. I think it's the best.</p><hr><p><b>fitri</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Such a very romantic movie! This movie also makes me cry.</p><hr><p><b>Sienna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was one of the best romance movies ever. Very rarely can a movie make me cry but I cried at this. Charlotte, you need to get a life. Just because you didn't like it it doesn't mean that you have to criticize others. One word. Jerk.</p><hr><p><b>lizzy b</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Hi jessie! Thank you for praying for my soul. I pity your poor soul and wasted life. I would like for you to know that I have a very fulfilling life- and I also know people with cancer. I do not need to find happiness by having a dangerously strong hope in something that cannot be proved, or being caught up in a romanticised world, but live life to the fullest by enjoying the real people I know in it and putting my best into life every day. I never want to have "such a strong faith as jamie sullivan does". This IS dangerous. I instead have faith in people I know and in myself. I also have love. These are not exclusive attributes of religion. I don't want to lose my life in a noble death for faith, but live a humble life on earth changing it and the people in it for the best I can. Besides I pity anyone who needs to have their morals written down in a book to follow or can't cope with their problems by themselves without praying to a supposed all-controlling entity. Having totally unquestioning faith is not something to be proud of, it is stupid and dangerous. Do not strive to do this. I do beleive that people can be nice to each other and change lives, but this movie is obviously very, very fake. To anyone who has been fooled by this movie, go out and live a real life and enjoy it instead of believing in this fantasy world. Aside from that, this movie is so overly sweet it makes me sick, and it is fake with morals that seem outwardly good but are really quite stupid and dangerous. Please keep an open mind to atheism.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was so sad. It is probably my second favorite sad/romance movie, my first is of course Titanic.</p><hr><p><b>george</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I agree with Charlotte somewhat. The film is about religion and as I am not a religious person, I found myself cringing at all preaching that was going on. I also think the dialogue was a little corny for the 1980's. Perhaps if it was set in a more romantic era like the 20's-50's Iwould have thought it a little more realistic, because as Charlotte says, nobody talks like that anymore. Mandy Moore was sickly sweet as always, but I have never liked her all that much anyway. In spite of all that, the movie was still entertaining. Not fantastic, but good for a rainy day.</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A wonderful movie. One of my fave romance/sad film (after Titanic). I found the reverand's attitude towards Landon kind of funny in the first half. For example when landon goes to ask permission to take Jamie out and he says "you can exit the way you entered".</p><hr><p><b>Izzie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It makes me cry every time, it's so sad although very uplifting. I only wish that I could read the book. This movie is certainly, in my opinion, one of the best ever.</p><hr><p><b>andi</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is my favorite movie! This is the best movie in the total history of movies! It is one that really makes you cry and I have no favorite parts, all of it is really good. I want a guy to treat me the way Landon treated Jamie and I want unfailing faith like Jamie. I also want to live in my mind instead of my body the way Jamie did, this is better than titanic, the notebook and tristan and isolde! All of those movies come after.</p><hr><p><b>manda</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is really one of my all time favourite movies. I went to the cinema to watch it and I cried, it really got to me. I watched it 5 times there and every time I cried. I now own it and every time I watch it it brings out my emotions. Really one of the best movies ever. Awesome cast. Loved it.</p><hr><p><b>Zel</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I hate starting fights on these things, but srsly, lizzie b, I have to say, your argument sounded a lot feebler (probably not a word) than Jesse's did, with a bunch more words. I'm not saying either of you are right or wrong, because obviously, it would be with a lack of empathy that I could say that. Of course there'll be someone who disagrees with the majority. I would find it quite amazing if someone had not. Also, I would wonder who rigged the comments. We all have different beliefs. I should think that we have all had that statement pounded into our brains by now, but hey, maybe I'm wrong. I, personally, thought it was a very interesting chick flick spin off. I happen to love chick flicks. What can I say; I'm a sap and a romantic. However, I also think that some of you were being a bit too harsh in your judging. Please, keep in mind, this was shot in about forty days (or so I've read). I thought it was rather good.</p><hr><p><b>brittney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing movie! Loved it, one of the best christian movies I have ever seen!</p><hr><p><b>Lisa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! I watched it for the first time yesterday. I'm French but I saw it in English and it's the best movie ever.It's so sad, I've never cried that much for a movie.</p><hr><p><b>bill</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is an awesome movie. I'll cherish this for the rest of my life. This movie teaches you that you can love someone even after death. It really brings out the true meaning of love. I love everything about the movie. I love the way Shane West fulfills her wishes. And the best scene is when Shane cries out while hugging his father, that scene brings tears rolling down. I wish we could get to watch more movies like this.</p><hr><p><b>Wendy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I give this movie a 10, along with other movies like the Notebook, Romeo and Juliette, Shakespeare in Love etc. Was great. Sure it's nothing like the book but honestly the movie touches your heart if you're the kind of person who believes that love and faith shall conquer anything. And just to know that Shane or so Landon is a guy that you will find once in a blue moon loves Jamie is so sweet. It's hard to find people in this world that are worth loving, so just letting that special someone know that you love them is very sweet and important. Even if it's just your siblings, parents or significant other. That's what Landon did for Jamie.</p><hr><p><b>morgaine c.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This could possibly be the BEST movie on earth. The perfect mix of romance, grief, remorse and anger/ frustration that make your heart flutter and your eyes drip buckets of salty water. Or at least mine did! I'm a sap for romantic films and this one tops them all. It's spectacular.</p><hr><p><b>Lindsay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was by far the best movie I have ever seen. It has a great message and it makes you appreciate life more. This movie got bad reviews and it was said that it would be forgotten in a month or two but truly I will never forget this movie. I am even going to read the book.</p><hr><p><b>Steffany</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was the best movie that I have seen in a long time. I love this movie, I cry every time I watch this movie. I love how the actors and actresses were in this movie, they pick the right stars to play in the movie. And shane west and mandy moore were the best. And I don't think that the movie would be the same if they weren't there. I love how even though he made fun of her he gives up his friends and his old life to be with her and to give her her dreams. Like for her to be in two places at once and to get a tattoo, and to be married where her parents were. And even though she was sick he didn't care he wanted to be with her, because he loved her. Ever since I seen that movie I have been wanting to be loved like that and someone to really care about me and stuff like they had in the movies. But it's not real life and I know that.</p><hr><p><b>serena</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This has certainly been one of the best films and novels. After falling in love with its words and emotions, I have learned nothing but to cry once I hear it or read it. I have come to say that I am waiting for the movie the rescue to come out, I know that will the best! But for now, a walk to remember raises my heart and empties my eyes with tears. And chicks, stop fighting. It's a happy movie and sad altogether!</p><hr><p><b>L.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A Walk To Remember was THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! No joke, no lie. It was happy and sad at the same time. Landon and Jaime made such a beautiful couple and I was really impressed with how Landon treated her. Oh, and I loved Jaime's song, "Only Hope". All in all, this is a must-see! And it is now my favorite movie! </p><hr></td>
