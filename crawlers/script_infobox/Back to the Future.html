It is a breath taking science adventure experience! It is put together with all the best actors and actresses! Michael J fox and Christopher Lloyd work together amazingly along with Leah Thompson , Thomas F Wilson and Crispin Glover!!!!! So get up out of your seat and order the trilogy NOW!!!!!!!!!!!</p><hr><p><b>Calvin Leiper</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I fell in love with Back To The Future part 1. Bob Gale sure is is Great! Micheal J Fox and Christopher Lloyd were great and worked well together. It's a must have for anyone into science and they probably need to be pretty bright cause it's really confusing. I found out there was three Back to the Future and got the boxset straight away. And if you're looking on th internet for the actual props they used on screen, don't bother beacause I have them all apart from the cool car they used for the Time machine. The DeLorean. I give it 10 out of 10</p><hr><p><b>Michael Clifton</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Back to the Future 1 is one of the greatest movies of all time, I've watched it on video so many times I've lost count. 

Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) time travels in a Time machine built as a DeLorean back to the year 1955
to insure his parents and own existance meets at a dance before big bully school boy Biff splits them up forever.     

Its real Science Fiction and fantasy effects that one wish they could escape from their own time as well.  

Just like Doctor Who, Bill & Ted rolled into one.      </p><hr><p><b>J-DOGG</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Unknown</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>WOW! Love It!</p><hr><p><b>Robert</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Just letting you know that that script is incorrect. It's a great movie, if you read the script it is November 5th, 1955 (not March 19th) and it is the Flux Capacitor, not the TFC.</p><hr><p><b>Ben Sedlak</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Honestly, I can condense everything I want to say about this movie into one word: UBER. This is possibly the best movie I have ever seen, apart from X-Men and Spiderman 1 (S-Man 2 was substandard). I haven't seen BTTF 2 or 3 yet, but I've just rented them!</p><hr><p><b>me</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>this script is different from the original, its only the 4th draft, but is cool to see a different version of events at the start of the film!</p><hr><p><b>Julia</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVE this movie!  Michael J Fox is amazing, as was Christopher Lloyd. I know it's never going to happen obviously, but I sure wish they'd made more of these. They're so much fun to watch!</p><hr><p><b>Hannah</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie! I love all three of them! They are very good. I used to watch them all the time when I was little, and I was so excited when I bought the dvd set. They choose the perfect actors and actresses, and I can never get enough of this movie. They are funny also!</p><hr><p><b>soul</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love that film, it's my favorite! I have the cassettes at home.</p><hr><p><b>Gemma</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love Back To The Future! All three movies are great and you just can't get enough of the storyline! Hope they do a special thing on TV about it soon, like a revisit to the important bits of the film and meet up with actors and actresses as they are now! SO COOL!</p><hr><p><b>Laurrie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My dad showed me all the films when I was like born, and ever since. I've learned every line and even after my 1000th viewing, I still enjoy it and laugh at everything. It is by far, one of THE BEST films I have ever seen. It's just so clever, and there is never a boring scene. If you have not seen the films yet, I'm very disappointed! PS. You'll love it.</p><hr><p><b>Fawn Mulvaney</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love back to the future and have since I was little. I was recently watching it on amc on tv and noticed something that I didn't remember. I even looked up the original script to see if there were any clues there. In the original movie I do not remember any terrorists. Doc got shot by not terrorists right? They were punks right. I don't remember any terrorists, why would there have been terrorists then? Does anyone have the original tape that has the version without terrorists. If anyone knows whether it is what it is or it is what it wasn't; a bit of editing after the fashion of george lucas with the new old dvd where they are having a party with the ewoks and the new old anikin is there instead of the old old anikin, then please let me know.</p><hr><p><b>Marwa</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Genius.</p><hr><p><b>Vinny Dellay</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>To answer your question Fawn. They were always Lybian terrorists. They came after the professor because he used their plutonium to power his flux capacitor and instead gave them a bomb filled with clock parts.</p><hr><p><b>Katie  E.</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I would have to say, this is the best trilogy I've ever watched and I just got the dvd set on Friday. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd seemed like they enjoyed working together. I love it when Michael sings Johnny B Good. I love this trilogy so much that I can't stop watching them.</p><hr><p><b>marty bueller</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The greatest time travel movie ever made. If there is any Time travel movie out there that is better than this, then I have never seen it. My third favorite movie. Next to The Mask and Star Wars. I am sad that the ride at universal studios has been shut down for 2 reasons. 1) I never rode it. 2) Nobody can never hear about the movie unless somebody tells them about it or if it comes on TV. See this movie if you have not.</p><hr><p><b>Jen</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>LOVE THE "BTTF" TRILOGY. Watched Part One just for the heck of it in February 2007. Fell in love with it. Went around singing The Power of Love for months, watched the movies again whenever I could. Have both the soundtrack and the trilogy DVD on my Christmas list. Told everyone I know about it (most just laughed and made rude remarks about Michael J. Fox's current condition). even have a great idea for a follow-up film..</p><hr><p><b>teenie</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great classic movie. Although the time travel thing is confusing not just in this movie but in movies like The Lake House and Premonition.</p><hr><p><b>Nicks</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A wonderful film and an instant cult classic. It's so very easy to mismanage time travel films, and although there is a blurring of the rules in this film these instances are forgivable because they are mainly for comedy. Which, by the way, is of a high quality. There are some obvious errors, but you will be rewarded with glorious details such as the 'Twin Pine Mall' storyline.

Despite what some of these reviewers say, you'd have to be REALLY stupid to find this film confusing. Either that or... or... Nope! I've got nothing!</p><hr><p><b>WeatherExperiment</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>While it's great to see this version of the script, it is not the final version that matches the film. I would love to see that script!</p><hr><p><b>1.21 gigiwatts</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A must have for all movie lovers, plain and simple. Back to the future is a fun time traversing adventure that never gets old. Classic films. Truly great. Anyway I gotta go.. although where I'm headed.. I don't need roads!</p><hr><p><b>Joker</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was one of the best films ever made, IMHO.  The overall concept was very original for its time.  There had been plenty of other movies involving time travel before it, but I'd have to say that this was the first movie I've ever seen that made something so implausible (as bending the space-time continuum) seem very likely.  Other movies, you see weird contraptions and spaceships doing stuff like that;  but not this film--in this film the time machine is a sports car; something you can go down to the dealership and purchase in real life (note: DeLoreans really can't be purchased off any lot anymore due to their rarity, but you get the idea), therefore adding to the notion that you probably could build a time machine out of any fast vehicle you may be lucky enough to own (lemme know if it actually works, lol).

As for making any more movies, nothing would ever beat the original, period.  But with the recent Hollywood trend of recycling classic films (i.e. remakes), it may be a matter of time (pun unavoidable) before someone gets the idea to remake the trilogy and update it for current audiences.  It could very well happen, especially now that the word is that DeLorean's back in business and getting ready to churn NEW 201X DMC-12s off the assembly line.</p><hr><p><b>Cass</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Back to the future has to be the best movie(s) ever made. I'm only a teenager and I fell in love instantly with this movie at a young age. I've watched it so many times I have lost count. The movie so happens to be a sci-fi movie but it's unlike any other one I've seen. It blends other geners into it like comedy and action. The actors work very well in it and make it believable. I esspecially like the part of Marty and Doc. Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Loyd work very well together. Overall great movie(s).</p><hr><p><b>Fraser Risk</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant movie. I'm now 15 but I first saw it when I was 10 and loved it, its my favourite movie and sine I first saw it i've gotten a special edition trilogy and posters and everything and I wish there was a 4th but all together it is the best movie ever made.</p><hr><p><b>vestige</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@Fawn Mulvaney- I remember going to see this film as a kid and there was a dsiclaimer that part of the film was damaged (in probably a projector burn through) and out for repair but you could still see the movie sans the 15 minutes damaged portion. It turns out it was the scene you speak of witht he terrorist. It jumps from Marty getting into the time machine to him walking across the street in 1955. If the burn through happened at a common splice point in the film it may have been a common occurence for all I know.</p><hr><p><b>Kristine</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is the best movie ever. I think Marty and Lorraine can be a great couple but it can't happen. Lorraine is so in love with Marty but Marty doesn't feel the same way because that is his mother in the future. Again it was such a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Joe</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my all time favorites. Love this film. It has such a memorable theme to it. When Marty goes back to 1955, the filmmakers did an excellent job making the set look like the 50's. A must see film before you die. Also, check out Part 2 and 3.</p><hr><p><b>Justatimetraveler </b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm 16 and many 'older' people told me something like: "Teens don't care about those old classics." and "Teens wouldn't unterstand this story.", but I could proof that's wrong. I asked my english teacher (I'm german by the way): "Do you know BTTF?" "Yes. Do you have the movies?" "Yes, of course." "Then bring them along, we'll watch them next time." and according to the reactions of my class mates they really liked it. If you never ever had watch them, then you must watch them. NOW.</p><hr><p><b>Rob</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Why is everyone commenting on the movie? This is a movie SCRIPT website- wouldn't reviews about the screenplay, not the movie, be more productive and helpful? Just saying. The screenplay by the way is flawless. Perfectly set up. Every set up is paid off brilliantly. One of the top 20 scripts ever written.</p><hr></td>
